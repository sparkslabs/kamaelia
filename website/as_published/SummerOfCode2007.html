<h1>Google Summer Of Code 2007</h1><div style="float: right; border: solid;" class="twoC"><b> Project ideas are later down the page but include:</b><br><ul><li>A file handle like interface to backgrounded Kamaelia components</li><li>Extend &amp; make more user friendly the Kamaelia Web Server</li><li>A Testing Framework for Kamaelia Systems</li><li>High Level Kamaelia 3D Modelling Components</li><li>Visual Editor for Creation &amp; Composition of Shard Components</li><li>Kamaelia Exemplar! What can you make that's cool?<br></li><li><b>Your Idea</b> (please see <a href="/Components.html">the component list</a> for inspiration of appropriate areas)</li></ul></div> Kamaelia has been accepted into Google's Summer of Code 2007, so we're very pleased to hear what projects you would like to do. The project list is at the bottom of the page, however please also read these guidelines first.<br><h3>What is Kamaelia?</h3>Well, let's answer this 4 ways.<br><ul><li>We have an <a href="/Introduction.html.html">introduction</a></li><li>There was <a href="../../../t/TN-LinuxFormat-Kamaelia.pdf">an article in Linux Format</a> that covered the Whiteboarding application</li><li>There was <a href="../../../t/TN-LightTechnicalIntroToKamaelia.pdf">an article in Linux Magazin</a> (germany) which discussed the key concepts in Kamaelia and a tour of key component types. This is probably most relevant to GSOC<br></li></ul>Finally, a short intro:<br><br><blockquote>Kamaelia's aim is to make highly concurrent systems natural to create and simple to maintain. (given a choice&nbsp; of forces the we choose the latter) We seem to be having some success in this and have a number of systems we've built using Kamaelia.<br><br>Kamaelia is primarily focussed around building networked, multimedia systems, tools and applications, however Kamaelia is a generic component framework &amp; toolset. The current implementation is in python, but the approach and concepts are portable with a proof of concept in python.<br></blockquote><h3>What Sort of Person We Looking For?</h3>We're looking for enthusiastic people to work on specific projects,
which are listed on our projects pages (to appear shortly) You don't
necessarily need lots of experience, indeed we've found a naivete can
actually help since you have less preconceptions about how code should
be written (And often more open to the component approach).<br>What we do expect from you though is a very clear interest in the project your doing as part of Kamaelia, and it <i>must</i> fit in with Kamaelia, or some other open source BBC Research project where there is a suitable mentor.<br><h3>We Want Code We Can Use</h3>In practical terms this means that we want to be able to put your code into the distribution for people to be able to use. This means printing out and signing a contributor agreement. Our contributor agreement is based on Python's, since our project is largely python based. What does this mean?<br><ul><li>We ask you to grant the BBC a BSD license on your code</li><li>This then allows the BBC to remain the sole originator of the MPL/GPL/LGPL main release. (This is useful in case the license is breached - having on licensor simplifies things greatly)<br></li></ul>If you're curious as to the specific wording, you can see a <a href="../../../Developers/SampleContributorAgreement">sample contributor agreement</a>.<br><h3>What we will expect of you</h3><ul><li>We will expect you to have done the MiniAxon tutorial <i><b>ideally before submitting your application</b></i>. This teaches you how Kamaelia essentially works under the hood (barring optimisations), and as a result we feel is vitally important.</li><li>We will expect you to, where practical, discuss your application with us on IRC or email <i><b>sooner rather than later.</b></i><br></li><li>We will expect you to attend our normal weekly IRC meeting, unless timezones simply don't work</li><li>We will expect you to attend a weekly guaranteed mentor time session. This is an hour long session but it's specifically there to allow you to have some guaranteed time with your mentor, rather than anything else.</li><li>We will expect you to have some plan for maintenance of your code after summer of code is finished. This can come in several forms. One option is to plan to be around after summer of code because you're doing a project you think is personally fascinating/useful. Another option is to aim to write your code with the intent of having it maintainable.</li><li>We will expect you to also track your work in two ways:</li><ul><li>To keep a development blog (can use your usual one if you like), which you update at least twice a week</li><li>To start a project task page for your work, and keep that up to date - creating subtask pages as and where needed.</li></ul><li>If you use code from other sources (eg the python cookbook, reference implementations) we expect you to quote your sources.</li><li>To have fun :) (What's the point otherwise? :)<br></li></ul><h3>Feedback!<br></h3>This is a wiki page. It uses dojotoolkit so you can edit this page an add your own ideas here, but please don't edit the text above!<br><h2>Ideas!<br></h2><i>Fleshing out now:</i><br><br><h3>A file handle like interface to backgrounded Kamaelia components</h3><div style="float: right; border: solid;" class="twoC"> The key point of this project is to make it easier to embed the usage of kamaelia facilities and systems in non-kamaelia based systems. It should also naturally simplify kamaelia systems. You <b>must</b> be able to show us that you have done the <a href="/MiniAxon.html/.html">MiniAxon</a> tutorial to do this project</div> This would enable traditional, non-kamaelia-component oriented systems to use the facilities of Kamaelia components in a manner similar to that of a filehandle, crossed with a dictionary.<br><br>A user would be able to do something like this:<br><blockquote><pre><b>from</b> kamaelia.background <b>import</b> background, likefile<br><br>background.start() <i># Start the scheduler in the background</i><br><br>page = []<br>P = likefile(HTTPClient("http://tinyurl.com/35fjbr"))<br><b>while</b> P.get("signal", False) != "shutdown"<b>:</b><br>   data = P.get("outbox")<br>   page.append(data)<br><br>P.shutdown()<br>pagetext = "".join(page)</pre></blockquote>   <br>In terms of context, this is a wishlist item for syntactic sugar to allow this sort of ability. The key thing is what's happening here.<br><ul><li><b><i>background.start()</i></b> starts a scheduler in a background thread.</li><li><i><b>likefile</b></i> takes a component, passes it to the scheduler and asks it to activate it - running it in the background, passing back an object as a handle.<br></li><li>The user can then interact with the component in a functional manner, much like reading from a filehandle. However due to having inboxes&amp;outboxes, you name which one you're acting on, like a dictionary.This would mean, for example, that you could start many many TCP connections<br></li></ul>for example, and have them all managed in a second background thread in a scalable fashion. Similarly it might be a pygame display with many many sprites, and so on.<br><br>This takes inspiration from the fact that a traditional filehandle actually abstracts away the fact that the operating system file handling can be quite complex, and writing of data to finally disk (for example) can happen after your programme has exitted. To you however, the operation appears simple.<br><br>The key benefit of this is that it will simplify embedding &amp; using kamaelia components in non-kamaelia based systems.<br><br><hr width='100%'><br><br><h3>Extend &amp; make more user friendly the Kamaelia Web Server</h3><div style="float: right; border: solid;" class="twoC"><b>Note:</b> The key aim of this project should be to support
the full range of HTTP methods in a fashion that is simple for a
web developer to extend and override.</div>The key intent here behind this project is to take the <a href="/Cookbook.html.html/HTTPServer.html">Kamaelia web server</a>, written as a by product of last year's Google summer of Code, and make it more usable and useful. Specifically this means extending support to all HTTP methods, making it simpler to extend and override, and ideally supporting WSGI based applications, or at minimum CGI applications.<br><br>A relatively novice user should at the end of this project be able to say something like:<br><br><blockquote><pre>from Kamaelia.Systems.WebServer import WebServer</pre><pre><br>WebServer(docroot="/data/mydocs").run()</pre></blockquote><br>In order to start a basic webserver which serves static content.<br><br>A more advanced user should be able to specify where CGI applications exist:<br><blockquote><pre>from Kamaelia.Systems.WebServer import WebServer</pre><pre>Extend &amp; make more user friendly the Kamaelia Web Server<br>WebServer(docroot="/data/mydocs", cgiroot="/data/cgi").run()</pre></blockquote><br>An even more advanced user may wish to support WSGI based application. No suggested syntax/API is given here since we would expect the student to explore programmer friendly scenarios here. It's worth bearing in mind that often web applications can care about HTTP method was used (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, etc) when making the request, so looking at how to deal with this would be useful.<br><br>CGI support should be relatively simple given the existence of the UnixProcess component, though some adaptation to support standard CGI environment variables is likely to be needed.<br><br>A key benefit of this project is that this would enable Kamaelia to have a native, single threaded, scalable, extensible webserver written in a Kamaelia style. This not only simplifies maintenance but opens up interesting opportunities in desktop applications since Kamaelia works well in that environment too.<br><br>There are some potentially very interesting applications possible as a result of a client side, but scalable webserver that can integrate easily with lots of other applications. If you're curious, chat to us on IRC.<br><hr width='100%'><br><h3>A Testing Framework for Kamaelia Systems</h3><br>This project would aim to produce something similar to unittest/jtest, but in a context and manner which makes sense for individual Kamaelia components and also for Kamaelia systems.<br><br>Clearly this is a two part project, and two different main use cases:<br><ul><li>It should be possible at the end of this project to systematically and programmatically, in a lightweight, useful manner test a component against an API and verify the output/behaviour matches expected results. This should include both expected data sources and results and unexpected data sources and results. Test cases should have a mode whereby any docstrings can be output along with an indication of success/failure to assist with documentation creation.<br><br></li><li>The other main use case is testing systems. For example, it should be possible to take a Kamaelia system that is designed to do a two phase commit, and test both succesful and unsuccessful scenarios automatically.<br><br>This could involve creating a customised scheduler to change timings and run orders, etc. Similarly there are opportunities to be had with block box system testing (treating a system like you would a component), facilities mocking for subsystems and facilities for mocking modules that subsystems use (eg mocking select &amp; socket when testing TCP code is particularly useful).<br><br>An example system that would benefit from this is testing that a peer to peer system which is designed to create a certain kind of mesh <b>does</b> indeed create the expected kind of mesh in the context of errors &amp; timeouts, missed data delivery and damage. (A test harness for this is essentially a simulation, but one that operates on the actual components &amp; system).<br><br>Tracing of data along linkages, and suggestions for how to check that data going across linkages is correct would also be useful.</li></ul><br>This is a project that is something we have wanted for some time, but is now becoming clear that it would be extremely useful as Kamaelia usage continues to grow. Informal test systems must give way to automated. It is also expected that any student working on this will look at the existing way systems are developed and tested.<br><br>The key benefit of this approach is to push an extra layer of system verification into software systems - specifically allowing the testing and verification of concurrent systems. This is something hardware systems have had for a long time now, but a practical toolkit and with a practical verification suite for concurrent systems for software is extremely attractive. The primary test cases for a framework are expected to be existing Kamaelia systems, however where necessary small, but focussed examples are likely to be needed as well.<br><hr width='100%'><br><h3>High Level Kamaelia 3D Modelling Components<br></h3>The purpose of this project is to produce higher level 3D primitives, <b><i>which are still components</i></b> such as walls, mannequins, water, clouds &amp; terrain for creating and interacting with 3D worlds, ideally in a human friendly way.<br><br>By doing so it will be easier to contstruct a variety of 3D models. The core of this idea started from looking at an artist's mannequin - the kind often made from wood and poseable. Having a basic starting mannequin that's unskinned would be extremely useful, since it bootstraps alot of basic 3D work. Furthermore, unlike a wooden mannequin we can change things.<br><ul><li>You can change the size of all the ovoids - such that as well as obviously different person shapes, you can do more - you can also change from human to animal. (given that skeletal structure for many animals is 4 limbs, a torso, head, ears. The only optional addition would be a tail)</li><li>It would make sense to be able to skin the mannequin</li></ul>Beyond this however, having some basic similar objects would make sense:<br><ul><li>A box with an optional number of wheels along the sides, of variable radius</li><li>A surface/terrain object - grassy, roadlike, sandy, watery</li><li>A "fluffy object" - think clouds, shrubs, bushes</li><li>A malleable tree. (think deformable fluffy object with a pole)</li><li>A wall object - or a hollow cube shape with optional entrances cut in the sides. (this approach is probably easier to work with)<br></li><li>Finally a slanted roof surface with 2 or more sides. (Two sides gives you a traditional house roof, 3 or 4 gives you a pyramid, etc)</li></ul>Texturing should ideally take into account the existing texturing options - that allow, for example, existing pygame components to be used as textures.<br><br>The practical outcome of this is that rather than using low level primitives of surfaces, a user could work at a much higher level.<br><br>The context of this project really revolves around the fact that last summer the Open GL components created were a success, and this is aimed at pushing usablility of these components up higher.<br><br>The key benefit of this proect is that it would become simpler to use Kamaelia for ad hoc 3D modelling. (Combined with the whiteboard's backplace, this could be extremely useful) These are all "for examples" - the mannequin &amp; wall/floor parts however I view as pretty core.<br><hr width='100%'><br><h3>Visual Editor for Creation &amp; Composition of Shard Components</h3>This boils down to creating an editor for making components out of pieces of components - shards. These pieces are also by definition components, but unlike normal Kamaelia components are more functional, single shot than generator or thread based. Ie they don't really control flow.<br><br>The practical result of this is that it should mean that you would be able to largely create/prototype new components for Kamaelia graphically. A user would be able to use an editor to take pieces of components (Shard Components, maybe) and join them together using some connectors wrapping control flow.<br><br>A <a href="http://thwackety.com/FunctionalComponents.png" target="_blank">diagram showing a potential component structure can be found here</a>. In this diagram you can see some parts of the diagram are reusable. Other parts can be reused as a chassis, and some parts simply can't be reused. The notation is based loosely on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Structured_Programming">JSP</a>, but the reason isn't to copy JSP (we're using it as a component system after all), but to use a metaphor that many developers are already familiar with. It is also relatively simple and completely abstracts out control flow - making components more likely to be reusable.<br><br>The project sits in the context that we already have a graphical composition tool (<a href="../../../Developers/Projects/Compose">Compose</a>) for standard Kamaelia component. However it is highly desirable to be able to create new low level components graphically.<br><br>Specific benefits of doing this project will be both the components created for editting essentially structured diagrams, but also the work done on developing the shards idea further. In the long term this offers opportunity to drive usability of the system up into the realms of the expert non-programmer user. Shards are a relatively new idea, so this project is partly about exploration of the problem space and partly about implementing the first pass at a useful tool.<br><br>Longer discussion on this topic has happened on the mailing list. (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31878613&amp;forum_id=43377">start of thread</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=31881069&amp;forum_id=43377">continuation</a>)<br><hr width='100%'><br><h3>Kamaelia Exemplar</h3>The aim of this project is for you to take something you've always wanted to do and create it using Kamaelia, with the aim of creating something which is a cool/useful demo/tool. (preferably useful tool :-)<br><br>The result of this should be something that you've wanted to build for sometime, that you think others will also gain from. From the perspective of the Kamaelia project, this should ideally be an exemplar of what can be achieved using kamaelia - be it...<br><ul><li>Large scale audio distribution, a second life clone, 3D game, 2D game, video player, video annotator, image manipulation tool, chat system, integration of handwriting &amp; shape recognition (and perhaps vector drawing) into the whiteboard application, etc</li></ul>The entire system should be created out of new and existing Kamaelia components.<br><br>The list of existing Kamaelia Components (excluding experiemental in /Sketches) can be found here:<br><ul><li><a href="../../../Components">http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Components</a></li></ul>The key benefit of working on this project from Kamaelia's perspective will be the creation of an exemplar project which has real benefits for the user - be it entertainment or practical. (The BBC <i><b>is</b></i> about entertainment among other things after all)<br>If you *do* do this one, please follow the template given below in "Your Idea as a title"<br><hr width='100%'><br><h3><i>Your Idea as a title</i></h3><ul><li>One sentance of what the task is designed to achieve/create.</li><li>A practical, clear result of what will be possible as a result of achieving this task. This is best described in the case of a user story.</li><li>The context in which this task sits. Has this task any history? Is it the result of any previous tasks - either within the project or outside.</li><li>What benefits will be gained by working on this task, and achieving its goals? Speculative as well as certained/realistically expected benefits are valid here.</li></ul><hr width='100%'><br>To be added over the next 24 hours.
