<br><br><h2>Timeline</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.kamaelia.org/ReleaseAnnouncement060">0.6.0 - Released</a> </li></ul>Note: the version numbering below is changing to date based versioning.<br><br>Releases to happen:<br><ul><li>0.9.5, Target: 31st May 2009</li><li>0.9.7, Freeze: 6th July 2009, Target: 13th July 2009</li><li>0.9.9, Freeze: 7th Sept 2009, Target: 14th Sept 2009</li><li>0.9.11, Freeze: 2nd Nov 2009, Target: 9th Nov 2009</li></ul>Beyond that date, this release schedule - which is based on "freeze on the first monday of every other month, and full release the following monday" - will probably need reviewing. If it seems appropriate, and if code has reached an appropriate stage, the release cycle will probably be this:<br><ul><li><b>1.0.2 - </b><b>Probable Full Release, Freeze: 1st Feb 2010, Target release: 8th Feb 2010</b></li><li>1.0.4 - Freeze: 5th April 2010, Target: 12th April 2010</li><li>1.0.6 - Freeze: 7th June 2010, Target release: 14th June 2010</li></ul>Reaching beyond that sort of timeline seems foolish, so I'm not going to try.<br><br><h2>Feature Roadmap</h2>Things that would be useful to go into releases...

numbers.</h3>Kamaelia's version number is pre-1.0 for good
reasons (as of Nov 2008) - there are specific things that (at least) Michael would like
to see in a full version 1.0. However, many projects are switching to a
more date based approach. Since we figure that we're about a year away
from being "feature complete" in Kamaelia (in terms of graphical
creation tools, full set of appropriate chassis, potential for shard
support, etc) it seems reasonable to switch to a versioning of <b>Y</b>.<b>Y</b>.<b>MM</b>.<br><br>This
is the reason for 2 releases before the end of the year - 0.7.0 being
the next logical one after 0.6.0, and the one after 0.7.0 being 0.8.12,
with 0.8.12 being the first release matching the new versioning scheme.<br><br>If the project keeps running then, then I would also expect the following:<br><ul><li>Y.Y.MM to be used as version number in 2009</li><li>
Y.Y.MM to be used as version number in 2010</li><li>1.MM to be used as version number in 2011</li><li>Y.MM to be used as version number 2012 - 2019(last digit of year only)</li></ul>
It seems really odd to be planning version numbers that far out, but
it's worth realising the first release of Kamaelia was in 2004, so 2012
is the same timeframe (or so) forwards. Not only that, but Kamaelia's
model does seem to have longevity.<br>
<h3>Timing? 6 Weeks? Bi-Monthly?<br></h3>These target dates are deliberately far enough to be
doable, but not so far that the planning for each stage to become
unrealistic. Also, they're specifically designed to prevent "mega"
releases being planned with "one more thing" preventing actual release.<br>

<br>-- Last updated November 2008<br><br>That didn't work. Shifting to 2 monthly cycles instead, since it feels more "humane" :-)<br><br>-- May 2009<br><br><br>

                    As of the <a href="http://www.kamaelia.org/ReleaseAnnouncement060">0.6.0 release</a> the project is moving through a transition stage.<br>
<br>
Future releases will be based on a bi-monthly release cycle, with version numbers based on dates, rather than arbitrary(!) version numbers.
