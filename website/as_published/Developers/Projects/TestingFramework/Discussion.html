<h1>Developers/Projects/TestingFramework/Discussion</h1>These are ideas gathered for the testing framework. This ideas are still being discussed, I just write this wiki page to be able to effectively reference them in an easy way (saying [foo1] instead of saying "that thing Foo said in the list that day..."). I'll update this page during the discussion.<br><br><h2>Convention</h2><br>I'm using the convention [xxxY] being xxx the first three letters of the nick of somebody and Y the number of the idea of this someone.<br><br>[orp?] -&gt; orphans<br>[dav?] -&gt; Davbo<br>[law?] -&gt; Lawouach<br>[cho?] -&gt; Chong<br>[jba?] -&gt; j_baker<br><br><h2>Ideas</h2><br>So the ideas, if I understood them correctly, are:<br><br>&nbsp; [orp1] Provide a given input to a components and check the outputs to check that the format is correct.<br>&nbsp; [orp2] Make sure that when you ask for it, it finishes.<br>&nbsp; [orp3] Check that a component has called the pause() method at some time<br><br>&nbsp; [dav1] A random set of pygame interrupts to the display<br>&nbsp; [dav2] A logging engine that can be enable/disable certain components so you can keep the printing of the messages in the code, but it will just not be showed if not wanted.<br><br>&nbsp; [law1] Be able to unit test components independently.<br><br>&nbsp; [cho1] Provide inputs for the component and expect output from it.<br>&nbsp; [cho2] Check variables in runtime.<br>&nbsp; [cho3] try..except helpful to prevent program from crashing but harmful when finding bugs. It would be nice if it could be disabled.<br>&nbsp; [cho4] Check which components are still running and which components are not.<br><br>&nbsp; [jba1] logging engine that can be enable/disable certain components so you can keep the printing of the messages in the code, but it will just not be showed if not wanted.<br><br><h2>Ordering the ideas</h2><br>Ordering them by functionality, we get:<br><br><ul><li>&nbsp;[orp1], [orp2], [law1], [cho1] essentially refer to a basic Axon-based testing framework.</li><li>[orp3] refers to a cool feature of the testing framework.</li><li>[cho4] refers to another cool feature of the testing framework.</li></ul><br><ul><li>[dav2] and [jba1] are essentially a logging engine, which may not be part of the testing framework (but it's still interesting since that's the other part of my GSOC project :-D )</li><li>[cho2] may be closer to what a debugger would offer, but since even local variables in a generator can be easily retrieved (see <a href="http://pastebin.com/m7a316728" target="_blank">here</a>), it might be interesting to consider it for accessing local variables in the component. This would be really cool, but I will not add it to a first stage.<br></li><li>[cho3] may use a method "independent of the testing framework" (in order to call something like "self.raiseExceptions" which re-raise the raised exception only if a certain variable is set), although later the testing framework would use that variable, I'm not sure if it's something tied to it.<br></li><li>[dav1] refers to an interesting feature that may not be integrated in an automated testing framework, although it may be possible through a virtual X server such as Xvfb. I have to give it another thought though.<br></li></ul><br><br><br>
