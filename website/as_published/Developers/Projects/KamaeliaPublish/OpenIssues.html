<h2>Kamaelia Publish Open Issues</h2>This page is intended to be a big "todo" list for Kamaelia Publish.&nbsp; It may or may not a lot of items that I would like to get done but may not have time for.&nbsp; So this page shouldn't be construed as being a part of my GSoC work (but some of it will be).<br><br><h3>Bugs</h3>The software still needs much more testing, so this really only represents a list of known bugs:<br><br><ul><li>When the gateway logs in, sometimes it receives messages indicating which users are online, sometimes it doesn't.&nbsp; The gateway should check a user's online status with the server before assuming they are offline.<br></li></ul><h3>Enhancements</h3><ul><li><strike>Make static content able to be served.</strike></li><ul><li>Static content is now served by the gateway.&nbsp; The peer is capable of serving such files, but such would be REALLY slow and somewhat more complicated.<br></li></ul><li>Add the capability to look up registered and possibly logged in users in a database.</li><ul><li>Partially completed:&nbsp; Registered users and whether they are logged in or not can be stored in a SQLite database.</li><li>sub-issue:&nbsp; Get the gateway able to use more different kinds of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.</li><li>sub-issue:&nbsp; Having to look up whether or not a user is online EVERY time will probably affect performance.&nbsp; Some kind of caching system should be in place. <br></li></ul><li>Add the capability to send data between the Gateway and serving peer directly.&nbsp; This can be done by either doing an XMPP file transfer or possibly bypassing XMPP altogether.</li><li>Look into getting the Peer to work on Python 2.2.&nbsp; Being able to run a webserver on Symbian would be Pretty Damn Cool (tm).</li><ul><li>This is definitely a "would be nifty" idea.&nbsp; I have no idea if this is even feasible or how much work would be involved in this.<br></li></ul></ul>
