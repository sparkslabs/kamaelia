discussed in the logs.

Matt queried plans for improving whiteboard audio. Michael noted
its about increasing the sample rate, filtering and then downsampling
before encoding to see if that improves the audio. Matt warned that
there'd probably be knockons.
 
Michael also noted the amount he's been blocked in the past week.
 
4. Discussion items (max 3 or 4)
 
4.1 Open floor
 
General discussion on some random items. Michael noted that it would 
be nice to do something similar to www.perladvent.org, but being
swamped this year prevented it. Issues with dojo (now resolved) didn't
help.
 
Michael noted that he's going to have to turn the website into a less
ephemeral document at some point soon for internal purposes. This will
also probably be done externally first. Biggest concern is keeping
that sort of document uptodate, so automating ODF production might 
get looked at.
 
Matt raised issue of case insensitive filesystems - basically they
exist, and whilst they're not the primary dev platform we should
be aware this and work around.
 
Currently the only problem file is passThough.py/PassThrough.py.
Decision taken for Matt to simply delete passThough.py.
 
5. Date/Time of next weekly meeting
 
Thursday 14th December 2006, 11am GMT 
 
Agreed.
