====== START OF WEEKLY KAMAELIA MEETING, 20060519 ======

Michael:
DONE: Wrote initial version of Macro.py - single channel grab, demux, transcode, dump
      Wrote basic description/design/spec of Macro for website
      Wrote one sider description of the project aims, goals, and milestones
      Installed & customised front end for macro
      Created tool to convert EIT info to blog entries & automated the process
      Checked in and debugged DVB_Multiplexer, DVB_Demux
      Optimised DVB_Demux to get to realtime for single channel on moderate capacity CPU.
      Modified Unix pipe very heavily to make better use of the selector component.
      Corresponding changes to selector
      Email all summer of code candidates letting them know that no news
      is not bad news, but not good news either, why and time scales.
      Fending off a late applicant to summer of code
      Encouraging Ryan to continue developing his Kamaelia skills (has
      now implement an IRC client, and a web server in Kamaelia)

TODO: *Google SoC - get Thomas/Student to assign students to himself (or else he won't have any)*
      Modify internet subsystem to be compliant with selector changes
      Merge inversion branch onto head
      Merge tests from threading branch
      Write detailed design document for Proper Macro
      Follow up with Kevin regarding one sider
      Update Huw, Ela, Kevin on SoC (project descriptions)
      Sort out next Axon/Kamaelia release
      Audit/update documentation as needed
      Propose candidate components to move into release tree.
      Improve website documentation - long spiely text and how its used.
      Summer of code: communicate results of summer code

BLOCKED: Internet connectivity: problems going through socks proxy to servers for copying files.
         Issue of inability to put servers on the internet despite requests from Senior Managers.
         Sourceforge: they can't run a service - CVS bust, new "resilient" architecture simply means more pieces to break.

Matt:
DONE: EIT Parsing (now & next data)
      Set up and installed HP/Macro demonstrator box
      Wrote an initial software demuxer in pyrex
      Copying of files from demonstrator to front end
      Debugging demux code
      Minor fixes to carousel, unix pipe, selector
      Extended upon michael's initial version & design of Macro.
      Minor change to DVB multiplex to control Front end parameters
      Implementation of crash first approach to programme segmentation

TODO: Anybox problem - looks at final destination inbox in a passthrough
      chain, this is broken :)
      (11:09:48) mhrd: change self.dataReady() to examine only storage directly local to the inbox
      Move threading branch axon tests to right location & notify Michael.
      Diagnose and debug issue with programme transcoder.
      Now and Next change detection needs to distinguish between programme
      update and programme junction.
      Write tests for the system inversion changes
      Synchronised boxes need reimplementing (needed really for UnixPipe
      code, would also simplify reading AND the selector)
      Many components don't play nicely with the inversion right now due to busy wait.
      Implementation of blocking based on a timer service of some kind
      (perhaps as component).
      Extraction of sys-status from Macro.py, into the introspection code.
      (Logical knockon, could be provided in Axon, and accessed through
      introspection code) NB: could become a route in to something equivalent
      to "top/ps"
      Audit/update documentation as needed
      Propose candidate components to move into release tree.
      Improve website documentation - long spiely text and how its used.

(note the todo list is a general list)

BLOCKED: Issues with stopping/restarting programme transcoder (let to crash first work around)
         (restarting at programme junctions)
         Internet connectivity: problems going through socks proxy to servers for copying files.
         Issue of inability to put servers on the internet despite requests from Senior Managers.
         Sourceforge: they can't run a service - CVS bust, new "resilient" architecture simply means more pieces to break.

Rest of meeting isn't relevant this week due to bimonthly meeting.
