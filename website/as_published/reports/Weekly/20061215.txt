Notes:
Re: Axon page: 

It had references to linkage etc, pipeline instead f Pipeline, missing
imports
Also it did: scheduler.... run rather than Component().run()
Matt suggested updating the Axon docs more fully.

Michael suggested Matt's RTP problem may be due to framing/deframing code 
speed

4. Discussion items (max 3 or 4)
4.1 Open Floor

Was a note to have an open floor for discussion if anyone wanted to raise 
anything. 
Michael wanted to make note of the fact that Lawouach had integrated the 
Kamaelia web server into his framework:
