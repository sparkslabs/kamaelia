            <tr><td>[18:23] &lt MS-&gt Interesting. Apps/Web-Server from JMB's branch isn't really a web server at all. It's actually a WSGI server. Nice idea, but needs work really to be useful.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:23] &lt MS-&gt ie it doesn't really try to do webservery type things at all, just act as a configurable wsgi host.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:23] &lt MS-&gt which is an interesting idea.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:24] &lt MS-&gt But difficult to configure IMO due to eventually munging everything into a single tar ball. (Good in some ways, less so in others)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:38] &lt MS-&gt Actually quite pleased with the way this refactoring is going. Extracting it all out as a separate app feels a lot cleaner.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:39] &lt MS-&gt Some parts are quite nice, and actually creating a ~/.kamaelia/appname/ directory for user configuration would help enormously I think.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:40] &lt MS-&gt Would then potentially be a very useful app for acting as a simple personal webserver of stuff - ie Jason's original intent</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:08] &lt MS-&gt Finally merged a major chunk of Jason's project - specifically the standalone webserver portion</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:08] &lt MS-&gt Packaged up and useful.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:08] &lt MS-&gt Rough around the edges, needs a bit more work, but potentially very useful in certain circumstances.</td></tr>
