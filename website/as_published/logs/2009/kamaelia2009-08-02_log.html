            <tr><td>[09:10] &lt MS-&gt What PEP342 does bring though is the ability to make exception handling cleaner if you want to try nesting things, and also the ability to kill generators (cleanly) by throwing exceptions into them</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:10] &lt MS-&gt It also gives you a way of killing threads which I really like the idea of :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[09:11] &lt MS-&gt You're right it cleans somethings up though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:11] &lt ronny&gt hmm, its a shame cpython wont get stackless</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:12] &lt MS-&gt It's a shame, but not a surprise. The fact it wasn't mainline and there was no apparent prospect of becoming mainline was the reason for not using it incidentally</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:13] &lt MS-&gt Though kamaelia does run a tad faster on stackless</td></tr>
