            <tr><td>[08:42] &lt Uraeus&gt hi</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:43] &lt MS--&gt Hiya - got a minute to chat ? (dirac related)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:43] &lt Uraeus&gt sure</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt MS--&gt OK. I had a chat with Tim Borer the other day, and I think I've mentioned before that Dirac is basically a dead duck here now</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt Uraeus&gt yeah you did</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt MS--&gt ie everyone's effort on it has now been diverted elsewhere.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:45] &lt MS--&gt Which is a shame :-(</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:45] &lt Uraeus&gt yeah it is :(</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:45] &lt MS--&gt Anyway, as you'd expect, Tim is looking round for someone (company I think) who might be interested in taking up the mantle and pushing it forward</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:45] &lt MS--&gt We bounced round a few ideas, and he was asking if I could think of anyone else who might be able to think of someone who might be</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:46] &lt MS--&gt and I mentioned that you/collabora may know of someone who might take it somewhere.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:46] &lt MS--&gt Big emphasis on "may" :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:46] &lt MS--&gt Just wondering if you had any suggestions really. Xiph appear to be pushing theora, which would suggest not xiph</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:47] &lt Uraeus&gt sell I think Xiph would be open to also take Dirac under their wings, considering that they have multiple audio codecs too</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:47] &lt Uraeus&gt and we are still (slowly) pushing Dirac here at Collabora as part of our PiTiVi effort</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:48] &lt Uraeus&gt which reminds me, we still need to get David Flynn to send us his notes on Dirac in MXF so we can complete that effort</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:49] *** MS-- nods</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:49] &lt Uraeus&gt but I think in terms of having another organisation take on the banner carrying for Dirac I do think Xiph.org is probably the best chance, unless a commercial actor with deep pockets can be found</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:49] &lt MS--&gt The other name that came up was maybe google - for that sort of reason - but they did recently buy On2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:50] &lt MS--&gt which given the history of theora made me wonder what they planned to do with On2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:50] &lt Uraeus&gt hmm, didn't know that, but Google would have been a great choice indeed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:50] &lt MS--&gt FWIW, Xiph was the first place I suggested to Tim</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:51] &lt Uraeus&gt Mozilla foundation would be another worthwhile choice, but I don't think they want to get involved on that level</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:52] &lt MS--&gt I don't think so either.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:52] &lt MS--&gt OK, thanks for the sanity check :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:52] &lt Uraeus&gt MS--: if you see david flynn around could you please put some pressure on him to get us the Dirac in MXF notes, I think in getting traction for Dirac, getting some movement in the editing field is still a good way forward</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:52] &lt MS--&gt Will do.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:53] &lt MS--&gt I'll prod him on an IRC channel though since he's on the other side of the country :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:53] &lt MS--&gt I wonder what Adobe would make of dirac ?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:53] &lt MS--&gt They'd resisted it for various reasons in the past, but if they pwned it?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:54] &lt MS--&gt That could be an interesting route thinking about it</td></tr>
