            <tr><td>[11:57] &lt MS-&gt I think so. I'm actually planning on spending the time I'd spend on GSOC normally on actually improving kamaelia instead - which strikes me as a good idea :)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:05] &lt MS-&gt Well, getting Steve's code merged was one thing, but I've also been experimenting with a new axon core</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:09] &lt MS-&gt I'm on leave for the next 2 weeks as well, so the first week I'll not do a huge amount, but the second week I plan to do a fair amount of kamaelia hacking.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:09] &lt Lawouach_&gt Problem is you have one single landing page for many different people from various background and expectations</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:09] &lt MS-&gt Yes, that is a key problem</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:09] &lt MS-&gt Jesse's talk at pycon - which spent ~2 minutes on kamaelia was helpful for making it clear what he thought is the problem</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:13] &lt Lawouach_&gt you probably need something at a higher level</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:13] &lt MS-&gt his point of "pulling out and showcasing Axon" was more of a side note</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:14] &lt MS-&gt I think the point is the site needs to follow through common use cases, and help with those.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:15] &lt MS-&gt It's the same sort of thing that Kathy Sierra has talked about for years as well.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:15] &lt Lawouach_&gt ain't easy though considering how much stuff Kamaelia does</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:16] &lt Lawouach_&gt perhaps focusing on Axon would be better</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:16] &lt MS-&gt Her starting point is to suggest treating learning complex things like computerr games</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:16] &lt MS-&gt Indeed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:16] &lt MS-&gt ie the idea being at each point people learn to do more.</td></tr>
