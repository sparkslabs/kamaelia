            <tr><td>[10:42] &lt MS-&gt No, but the docs are as noted autogenerated. I can point you at the code that creates them if you'd like to do that...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:02] &lt dsuch&gt MS-: sure, thanks</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:02] &lt dsuch&gt I just noticed too many 404 :/</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:02] &lt dsuch&gt I know you're aware of it, just read half of the IRC logs</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:03] &lt dsuch&gt hence I thought having it combined in one PDF would be easier to follow</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:50] &lt dsuch&gt http://paste.ubuntu.com/277118/ - my goal is to have 5 parallel consumers to handle data, each consumer should receive its own message and process it in a blocking manner, could it really be that easy?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:51] &lt dsuch&gt well, not really 'should block' as much as 'will block'</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:20] *** eikenberry_ has joined #kamaelia</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:21] &lt dsuch&gt I should mention that producer is much faster than consumers are, that's why I'd like to parallelize it.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:25] &lt MS-&gt (was getting lunch)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:27] &lt MS-&gt OK, at present there isn't a specific component that will directly achieve the goal you want to do there, but the good news is there's a fair few that do.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:27] &lt MS-&gt It's also the sort of thing that it would be nice for the PAR component to handle naturally for you, but that doesn't do what you want in this case.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:28] *** MS- rummages in SVN</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:28] &lt dsuch&gt I was wondering whether the Carousel and/or Fanout would be of help here?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:28] &lt MS-&gt Carousel isn't really quite what you want, and fanout/splitter copy the data to all the recipients</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:29] &lt dsuch&gt ah, copying, no good here</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:29] &lt MS-&gt yep</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:30] &lt MS-&gt This isn't quite what you want, but it's similar</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:30] &lt MS-&gt http://code.google.com/p/kamaelia/source/browse/trunk/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/Europython09/Util.py#92</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:30] &lt MS-&gt That's a two way balancer component</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:30] &lt MS-&gt which can send 1/2 the data one one and half the other</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:30] &lt MS-&gt Which could be extrapolated better</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:30] &lt MS-&gt But it's not ideal</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:31] &lt MS-&gt What you ideally want is a component that passes data to a Queue.Queue and that Queue.Queue becomes the inbox for a collection of components</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:31] &lt MS-&gt allowing which ever one is ready to just consume the data</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:32] &lt MS-&gt Which is a more complex level than you want here</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:32] &lt MS-&gt I'm sure I've written something like what you're after though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:32] &lt dsuch&gt in that case, I'm now wondering what I have done in that code :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:33] &lt MS-&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:33] &lt dsuch&gt but hey, no hints please!</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:33] &lt MS-&gt heh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:33] &lt dsuch&gt I'd like to understand it myself :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:33] &lt MS-&gt You sure ? (I'd assumed that was a joke :) )</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:34] &lt dsuch&gt yea</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:34] &lt dsuch&gt er, I mean I'm sure</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:34] &lt MS-&gt k. I would suggest looking at the source for the PAR component:</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:34] &lt MS-&gt http://code.google.com/p/kamaelia/source/browse/trunk/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Chassis/PAR.py</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:35] &lt MS-&gt But I'll not say why :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:35] &lt dsuch&gt I feel like I'm missing something fundamental about it, that's why.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:35] &lt MS-&gt k</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:35] &lt dsuch&gt ok, will take a look at PAR, thanks</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:36] &lt MS-&gt You've found the tutorial notes btw I hope ?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt dsuch&gt um, so I have a list of consumers forwarding the message to next one in the chain, heh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt dsuch&gt I think I've found it, I'm actually reading it all, in no particular order :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:52] &lt MS-&gt cool. I personally wouldn't do the list of consumers :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:53] &lt dsuch&gt But why did you say PAR wasn't what I wanted? It seems to be exactly what I want (parallel execution) except perhaps for the policy of exiting as soon as children exit?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:54] &lt dsuch&gt You mean the very approach could be different?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:54] &lt dsuch&gt Or that you wouldn't make such a basic mistake :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:59] &lt MS-&gt PAR is very close.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:00] &lt MS-&gt You just want to send the messages that come into it to the first available component</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:01] &lt MS-&gt Your producer feeds it, and then your derivative of PAR doles messages to components inside it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:01] &lt MS-&gt This has the other other half of what you're looking for I think: http://code.google.com/p/kamaelia/source/browse/trunk/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/Europython09/BB/LineOrientedInputBuffer.py#31</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:02] &lt MS-&gt maybe</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:02] &lt dsuch&gt ah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:02] &lt dsuch&gt and I was wondering how to prevent the producer from peeking at consumers' inboxes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:02] &lt MS-&gt It's still not as elegant as the queue approach I mentioned though. Which is a shame</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:03] &lt MS-&gt yeah, peeking at consumers' inboxes is kinda nasty</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:03] &lt MS-&gt Or at least not guaranteed to be correct</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:04] &lt dsuch&gt soo.. when the outbox is empty it means we /probably/ have at least one consumer available? otherwise the messages would be queuing up in the outbox?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:10] &lt dsuch&gt or not at all, there would be one outbox per consumer so I would need to iterate through them, find an empty one and then put a message there</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:11] &lt dsuch&gt or I should simply write some code and test it myself :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:25] &lt MS-&gt i always prefer the "play around and write code" approach myself :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:26] &lt MS-&gt You may want to see what happens to the inbox of the recipient after to send a message to an outbox.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:26] &lt MS-&gt I could say more explicitly than that, but you asked me not to :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:37] &lt dsuch&gt heh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:43] &lt dsuch&gt oh, have you perhaps found the code for generating documentation?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:50] &lt MS-&gt http://kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kamaelia/trunk/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Tools/DocGen</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:50] &lt MS-&gt Contains the tools for creating the docs</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:50] &lt MS-&gt ie inside the Tools directory :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:55] &lt dsuch&gt cheers</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:58] &lt MS-&gt You're welcome. I've wanted to spend sometime redoing the docs, but I've just not had the time and energy to do that. Very much welcome anything there :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:03] &lt dsuch&gt sure, I understand it, but don't worry, looking at the logo makes up for any difficulties :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:17] &lt MS-&gt :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:24] &lt MS-&gt Right, back later. (probably) Off to python-north-west :-)</td></tr>
