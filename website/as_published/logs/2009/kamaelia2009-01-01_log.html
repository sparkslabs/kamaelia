            <tr><td>[20:32] &lt MS-&gt It doesn't look like they did view it as them having any say - ""the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on."" - from the article you posted</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:32] &lt MS-&gt IIRC the IWF create blacklists for people running filtering proxies</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:34] *** vmlemon_ wonders where the overaggressive and obnoxious Orange Safeguard service got it's data from, yet it seemed to block mostly harmless stuff like Digg and Google Groups, yet also allowed content that some would consider problematic... </td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:35] &lt vmlemon_&gt Doesn't look like 3 do any stupid filtering like that, though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:37] &lt vmlemon_&gt Not sure if it gets aggregated with data from other organisations (e.g. St. Bernard and the NetNanny and CyberPatrol folks), for what it's worth, although OpenDNS offers a DNS-level service based on some "industry standard" proprietary blacklist</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:38] &lt vmlemon_&gt Kind of annoying that this nonsense causes problems for the folks who have no interest in viewing questionable content, for what it's worth</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:42] &lt vmlemon_&gt Exactly</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:44] &lt vmlemon_&gt I know they have good intentions (supposedly) with these things, but you know they're broken when they block otherwise legitimate sites like Digg, Google Groups and the Forum Nokia developer sub-sites, and end up breaking several others by preventing JavaScript and things from being loaded correctly</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:45] &lt vmlemon_&gt They'd be more useful if they blocked toxic gunk like DoubleClick's "services" and AdBrite</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:47] &lt vmlemon_&gt Hell, if I remember correctly, Orange's implementation blocked either Orkut or Plaxo, yet allowed people to use a rather hobbled version of the Facebook site</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:48] &lt vmlemon_&gt I assume that it's a case of "one person's trash is another's treasure", and conflicting views about things</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:48] &lt vmlemon_&gt I agree about context, though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[23:46] &lt MS-&gt OK, 2 branches left, to do, both will need some proper TLC. (One needs docs and the other needs maturing really, if to be merged at all</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[23:47] &lt MS-&gt Will do the simpler one tomorrow now</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[23:50] &lt MS-&gt After those are in a state I can be happy with, I'll be able to shift over to implementing the proper Kamaelia DSL that it's now clear we need :-)</td></tr>
