            <tr><td>[09:59] &lt Lawouach_&gt I've found that one of the most complicated aspect of integrating Kamaelia was its... er... difference</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:00] &lt Lawouach_&gt It doesn't have an OOP API for instance</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:00] &lt MS-&gt In a way that's the idea behind the Handle aspect - since it should allow people to build OOP APIs to components</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:00] &lt Lawouach_&gt and sometimes it's hard to explain why there is so much verbosity in complex graphlines</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:02] *** MS- nods</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:03] &lt MS-&gt In a way though those are both driving aspects of kamaelia - as a reaction against the less readable approach you get with something thats more reactor based</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:04] &lt MS-&gt But Gloria's talk was interesting for emphasising that there is a difference about K which people find difficult initially to grasp</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:04] &lt MS-&gt more so if they're experienced devs, which tracks</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:04] &lt MS-&gt That ties into the other plans I've got - to split the website up much better</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:05] &lt MS-&gt split out Axon, Kamaelia & Apps in a much cleaner way</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:05] &lt Lawouach_&gt that sounds sensible to me</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:05] &lt MS-&gt To enable also having a better set of docs for each part</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:06] &lt MS-&gt "this is how you build a miniaxon" -- already clear</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:06] &lt MS-&gt "this is how you build components" -- could be better</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:06] &lt MS-&gt "this is how you build applications" -- not clear enough by far</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:06] &lt Lawouach_&gt and afterall, allow people to Axon on its own outside of Kamaelia. It's already possible but I doubt anyone makes the distinction.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:06] &lt MS-&gt Yep. Jesse picked up on that, which I found useful</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:06] &lt MS-&gt Also, I want to push into Axon a collection of base components that seem to be useful in lots of code</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:07] &lt MS-&gt ie which form a DSL for kamaelia systems - with the obvious ones being Pipeline & Graphline</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:08] &lt Lawouach_&gt right</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:10] &lt MS-&gt It also makes Axon more useful out of the box.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:54] &lt MS-&gt My guess is pip+virtualenv+setuptools hate it when you have data files</td></tr>
