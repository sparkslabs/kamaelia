            <tr><td>[17:12] &lt MS-&gt I think Kamaelia would've performed awful on that test for what it's worth, for a couple of reasons.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:12] &lt MS-&gt Firstly, we've not really done the optimisations that would make that test fly</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:12] &lt MS-&gt secondly, we use select, not epoll</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:12] &lt MS-&gt thirdly, I'm not convinced of the performance of the HTTP code</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:13] &lt MS-&gt That said, I don't think the performance would be bad really - awful in terms of comparison, but not bad</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:14] &lt MS-&gt Also, I think when I get a chance to work on axon2 properly for merging that would change things quite dramatically since that is a significant performance difference</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:14] &lt MS-&gt However without _trying_ these things it's pure speculation.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[17:15] &lt MS-&gt I think though, I'm not too worried about that tbh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:15] &lt MS-&gt My aim really was always for the system to be _optimisable_ to something very fast, rather than to build something optimised up front</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:16] &lt MS-&gt But then that goes with my general ethos of "get something working; check you're doing the right thing; make it fast"</td></tr>
