            <tr><td>[11:18] &lt MS-&gt (AFAICT his branch can't be merged as is because it contains lots of code which isn't actually used by anything outside the lib of components, and the sole example that does use it all in theory, doesn't actually work)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:18] &lt MS-&gt Rather annoying given it was claimed "ready to merge" and that I've spent a good couple of weeks reviewing it</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:27] &lt MS-&gt And if I read that the answer is pretty clear - either reject the branch or rip out all the things which are in it which aren't OK</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[14:00] &lt MS-&gt sent an email to this list pointing out which bits of code are the issue and that without decent examples, I can't verify if the code in the branch works or not, and hence left with the choice of</td></tr>
