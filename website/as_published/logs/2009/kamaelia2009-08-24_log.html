            <tr><td>[11:46] &lt MS-&gt what's up?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:48] &lt Uraeus&gt MS-: well being in the TV industry I was wondering if you would be able to explain to me what the real benefit of having higher Hz (100,200) rate on a LCD TV, googling about I found a very unclear mix of people claiming its all marketing and other claiming it actually brings value</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:49] &lt MS-&gt The bigger the screen, the bigger the effect.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:49] &lt MS-&gt ie if you have a really large screen, a higher refresh rate makes a difference, but it does need to be a big screen</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:49] &lt Uraeus&gt and with a difference you are talking about reduced motion blur?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:50] &lt MS-&gt A colleague was looking into the effect (or not) of high framerate video relative to ultra high def TV. (about 8K pixels wide)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:50] &lt MS-&gt It's to do with aliasing. Motion blur is actually pretty necessary with low frame rate video</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:51] &lt MS-&gt Because it's the motion blur that makes the eye get "enough" information to figure out the rest</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:51] &lt MS-&gt Also, it's much more of an issue with left to right pans than up/down</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:52] &lt MS-&gt which is why film credits rarely go faster than a certain speed and also why left/right pans are also normally limited</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:52] &lt Uraeus&gt ah ok</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:52] &lt MS-&gt Essentially it exhibits as a nasty flicker</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:53] &lt MS-&gt With a CRT you don't get the effect due to natural blur in the CRT</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:53] &lt MS-&gt with LCD, as they've gotten bigger and better it's become an issue</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:53] &lt Uraeus&gt sort of nominally been looking at buying a new TV for a while, but always found it really hard to know what factors to really look for and knowing if the claimed advantages are real. ia contrast rates and refresh rates etc.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:53] &lt MS-&gt By large though, I do mean *large*</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:53] &lt MS-&gt ultra HD screens are wall size</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:53] &lt Uraeus&gt yeah, I am looking mostly in the 40"-45" range</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:54] &lt MS-&gt 45" is where you would probably start benefitting</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:54] &lt MS-&gt 40" for a responsive screen - depending on how far away from the TV you're sitting</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:55] &lt MS-&gt Some high end TVs do some interpolation for example, which could be beneficial</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:55] &lt Uraeus&gt TV advertisements are quite horrible, for instance Sony adds always mention that it uses Bravia engine version 2 or version 3 etc., but I have yet to find a clear description explanation what this engine supposedly does and why its better than the branded engines in other manufacturers</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:55] &lt MS-&gt http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp169.shtml is the whitepaper I've been looking for</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:55] &lt MS-&gt They're just different versions of their own engines really</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:55] &lt MS-&gt The difference is probably manufacturing cost and small feature gains, I would hazard a guess</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:56] &lt MS-&gt It's not really in their interests to spell out precisely how much better they are or precisely what they do</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:57] &lt Uraeus&gt yeah, well for me as a consumer of course it ends up sounding like a marketing name for something which might not have any advantages of what a competitors TV does</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:58] &lt MS-&gt Well, indeed - it sounds exactly that way to me as well. Perhaps even more cynical.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:58] &lt MS-&gt :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:59] &lt Uraeus&gt found a description on dabs.com claiming its a collection of image filters meant to improve image quality, wish I would find a site done by someone competent enough to test for and verify/debunk such claims</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:01] &lt MS-&gt Well ,that would track with this comment: Manufacturers have recently started to add hardware inside LCD</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:01] &lt MS-&gt televisions to perform a motion-compensated frame rate doubling, which ameliorates the problem</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:01] &lt MS-&gt to some extent at the cost of introducing other artefacts when the motion becomes too hard to</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:02] &lt MS-&gt Which is from the white paper above</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:04] &lt MS-&gt For me it's a largely theoretical issue BTW, I wouldn't have the space for a 45" TV :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:45] &lt Lawouach_&gt I'm actually to but one LCD TV this week and I think I'll go for a 37"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:45] &lt Lawouach_&gt the 40" would just kill me eyes considering the size of my living room</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:46] &lt MS-&gt :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:46] &lt Lawouach_&gt I find in fact funny they sell bigger screens in the UK considering the size avarage living room size over there</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:46] &lt MS-&gt I'm pondering getting something bigger than our 21" CRT (which is equivalent to a 19" LCD)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:46] &lt MS-&gt Yeah, our living room isn't huge.</td></tr>
