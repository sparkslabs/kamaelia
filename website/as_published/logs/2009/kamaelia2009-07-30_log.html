            <tr><td>[13:38] &lt MS-&gt Want to receive that & dump it to disk, with the varying bit rate</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:39] &lt MS-&gt And then later on re-read the file. at that bit rate, with the same variances.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:39] &lt MS-&gt Strikes me as something that should be easy, but I think I need a break</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:44] &lt MS-&gt eg 40 milliseconds is a nice number since that gives 25 chunks per second.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:49] &lt MS-&gt I can then write them in the same format that the standard "chunk" module reads. (ie IFF format)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:08] &lt MS-&gt heh, actually it's a perfect file format to choose thinking about it. It's 24 years old.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:20] &lt MS-&gt Right, I think I have my timed file writing source now</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:54] &lt ronny&gt IFF?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:55] &lt ronny&gt ah, images?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:02] &lt MS-&gt Actually no (well not really), IFF is a general file format for storing binary data in a convenient tagged and chunked manner</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:03] &lt MS-&gt the standard libraries "chunk" module handles reading of it natively</td></tr>
