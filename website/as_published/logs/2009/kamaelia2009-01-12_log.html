            <tr><td>[21:29] &lt MS-&gt Reading the logs for it, I'm quite pleased with that. Does tell a half decent story</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:30] &lt MS-&gt It's quite fascinating these things actually IMO</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:30] &lt MS-&gt I'm realising that there's a higher level concurrency co-ordination DSL in the system now that if made explicit would be kinda handy</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:30] &lt MS-&gt ie the sort of thing that would normally be viewed as patterns</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:34] &lt MS-&gt I think I'm going to need to look at what is actually transformed from what to what and why in more detail</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:34] &lt mhrd-home&gt of SimpleServer / ServerCore ?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:34] &lt MS-&gt (web server stuff) I think actually it's just a particular protocol, and he's viewing it as a translator which doesn't make sense</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:35] &lt MS-&gt well it makes sense to him and I can see his logic, but it looks odd</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:36] &lt MS-&gt MessageDemuxer in here: http://kamaelia.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Sketches/MPS/Examples/AIM/MultiAIMBot.py - may form the basis for a generic - non network related - in process server</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:37] &lt MS-&gt ie like the generic pattern you see in pygame display etc</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:39] &lt mhrd-home&gt interesting - so that demuxer creates outboxes as it thinks it needs them</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:39] &lt mhrd-home&gt thats quite neat</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:40] *** mhrd-home wonders if it leads to complications when wiring up a system - since it won't be possible to wire to a particular outbox until messages start being routed to it (causing it to be created)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:41] &lt MS-&gt It's more the sort of thing that pygame display & servercore/et al tend to do</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:42] &lt MS-&gt So it more enables a particular type of thing really</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:45] &lt mhrd-home&gt I think I thought about the same thing, but from the opposite direction ages ago: http://www.kamaelia.org/Components/pydoc/Kamaelia.Experimental.Services.html</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:45] &lt mhrd-home&gt kinda liked what I built there, but it was awfully prescriptive</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:46] &lt mhrd-home&gt and didn't attack the big issue (that you've just been talking about) of abstracting away the behaviour in the component that provides the service/demuxing capability - to make it easier to write</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:46] *** MS- nod</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:47] &lt MS-&gt Well the thing is, ServerCore is actually almost network independent, it just doesn't look like it</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:48] &lt MS-&gt  ... actually implement something else more like message demuxer perhaps</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:58] &lt MS-&gt I think your code tangles up the logical opposite/combination</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:59] &lt MS-&gt (ie if MessageDemuxer can be like an in-process server</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:59] &lt MS-&gt then your code tangles up the logical counterpart to TCPClient into one thing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:59] &lt MS-&gt ie the sort of "Mistake" we made a lot back then :)</td></tr>
