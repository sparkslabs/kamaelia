            <tr><td>[19:34] &lt j_baker&gt MS-: I just made a post to the mailing list to try to clear up some issues that seemed to be confusing based on the comments. I'll be here for a little while if you have questions.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:38] &lt MS-&gt The explanation of what your naming means is useful. As noted in my comments I was very aware that you were probably very clear on what you mean by them, but the meaning isn't clear.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:39] &lt j_baker&gt Understandable. I had to think about them myself when I first looked at the branch again. :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:40] &lt MS-&gt That's the problem with naming - it's one of the harder things to do</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:41] &lt MS-&gt Which isn't really what you mean - you're really stripping the stem</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:42] &lt MS-&gt I did think about doing things piecemeal - in terms of renames</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:42] &lt MS-&gt and then I thought actually going through it all and then reviewing would make more sense.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:42] &lt MS-&gt It took a long while to come up with the term "Chassis" for example</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:42] &lt MS-&gt But we went through things including the phrase "Backplane"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:43] &lt MS-&gt which made us go "Hmm, OK, park that one, maybe come back to"</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:44] &lt MS-&gt Also, as you can probably tell, I'm pondering renaming the original components names in the HTTP code - since they're not fantastic really</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:44] &lt MS-&gt But I also don't want to screw over the rest of the code in your branch in the process :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:44] &lt MS-&gt for obvious reasons :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:44] &lt j_baker&gt Agreed. :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:44] &lt j_baker&gt (on both counts)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:45] &lt MS-&gt Also, re putting in Support - I liked that BTW</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:45] &lt MS-&gt Which is perhaps difficult to tell just from the random annotations :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:46] &lt j_baker&gt Meh. It would seem kind of dumb to mark up the things I did right.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:47] &lt MS-&gt It's all technically "right" since the code works. :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:47] &lt MS-&gt It's also all a massive improvement :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:47] &lt MS-&gt which is so much easier to see in discrete chunks like this :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:48] &lt j_baker&gt Indeed. I felt like the previous HTTPServer setup encouraged too much code duplication (but did allow for a lot of modification).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:50] &lt MS-&gt You have to remember that Ryan did it as a side project during GSOC 2 years back, without being prompted and just went off and did it. Since he was massively ahead on his main project it was fun to watch and got to a very useable state given the short time period.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:50] &lt MS-&gt There are some parts which are painful though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:50] &lt MS-&gt as you've seen</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:51] &lt MS-&gt Also r0ml likes to say "release the crap & then improve"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:52] &lt MS-&gt To be fair it's not that bad - just naive in many places, and Ryan was pre-university :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:17] &lt j_baker&gt Sorry about that, got tied up doing some tech support (which sucks because I got hired as a programmer). Anyway, got to go catch the bus. See you guys later!</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:51] &lt mhrd-home&gt apologies if this is going back over old territory: just noticed what looks like a race condition in Axon.background :</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:51] &lt mhrd-home&gt there's nothing in the start() method to force it to postpone returning until the thread has finished starting up the scheduler</td></tr>
