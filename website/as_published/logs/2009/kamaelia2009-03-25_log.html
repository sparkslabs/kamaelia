            <tr><td>[14:11] &lt MS-&gt Or is just a pointer to here the most sensible thing?</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[14:12] &lt ezod&gt i can submit the ebuild to the gentoo bugtracker and try to get a dev to adopt it as maintainer</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:13] &lt ezod&gt that way it would be in the official tree</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:13] &lt MS-&gt That would be really neat :)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:45] &lt vmlemon_1&gt Unless they check User-Agents, although they're easy to spoof</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:45] &lt wyleu&gt I remember BT's solution when faced with a problem was to reinvent the market until it matched theri desires, then wonder why no one bought into it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:46] &lt wyleu&gt Just like Msoft blocking browsers that didn't ident themselves as IE as happened in the early days.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:46] &lt vmlemon_1&gt And now everything calls itself Mozilla, and claims to be Internet Explorer, or "like it"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:47] &lt vmlemon_1&gt Although that's slowly starting to change, as clients claim that they're "like Firefox" or "like Safari"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:47] &lt wyleu&gt I just don't back a radio station based on some carefully calculated market analysis, I just get bored,and I'll do that at any time.... End of.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:48] &lt vmlemon_1&gt I think I used their scrobbling and recommendation features more than the radio</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:49] &lt wyleu&gt It's worse for the music biz cos they claim to be fellow admirers of the art, and whilst that was spportable when there was a physical product, it ain't true in the virtual world.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:50] &lt wyleu&gt I'm a bit of a guerilla if it ain't free I won't use it. I like music but I'll make my own as much as listen to other people and I'll give it to anyone who cares to ask and sell it to advertising agency ( in my dreams)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:52] &lt vmlemon_1&gt I've always found their full-track previews more convenient than P2P services, although ripping YouTube audio tracks from FLV files with MPlayer is always an option</td></tr>
