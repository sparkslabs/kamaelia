            <tr><td>[11:51] &lt MS-&gt All sorts of code will break with it. Especially network code.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:54] &lt Lawouach_&gt it's interesting to see that when at full load, the process is reported to tokae 25% of my CPU but since I have 4 cores in my CPU, I assume it takes 100% of one of them</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:56] &lt MS-&gt I'm not certain of that. It depends on your ps command</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:56] &lt MS-&gt it'll say each of them at 99-100% of CPU</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:57] &lt MS-&gt Or even &gt100% of CPU.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:01] &lt MS-&gt If your code just relies on pure python code, it *may* be worth trying iron python?</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:04] &lt Lawouach_&gt it could be the MySQL driver of ejabberd, or at least my MySQL server being a bottleneck</td></tr>
