            <tr><td>[13:04] &lt MS-&gt That's why the scheduler gained the zap method :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:04] &lt Lawouach&gt I'm wondering, are those processes real unix processes with their own Python vm?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:04] &lt MS-&gt yes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:04] &lt Lawouach&gt or do they share the Python VM instance?</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:06] &lt MS-&gt I suspect that multiprocessing does the same</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:06] &lt MS-&gt yes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:06] &lt Lawouach&gt right</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:07] &lt Lawouach&gt The thing is, I find the multiprocessing package very tempting for some long tasks I have to run but once inside a forked process, I'd like to use Kamaelia to perform the actual job :)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:09] &lt MS-&gt which shows that it can have similar issues.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:15] &lt MS-&gt BTW, how would you feel if I mirrored your Kamaelia apps into Kamaelia.Apps ? (eg Kamaelia.Apps.Bucker or Kamaelia.Apps.bucker ) ? The idea is to make it easier for people to reuse components from inside other apps.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:16] &lt MS-&gt I'm planning on opening Kamaelia.Apps up more widely, and reserving namespaces for known existing apps</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:16] &lt MS-&gt I'd imagine that at the moment it just doesn't fit or make sense at all</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:17] &lt MS-&gt But I'm planning on trying to make it easier to reuse whole kamaelia apps for other stuff. (much like reusing the whiteboard code in the scribble n write app & scribble n link toy)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:20] &lt Lawouach&gt I'm fine by it and the license allows it :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:21] &lt Lawouach&gt that being said, I don't actively maintain all of those products (though headstock is currently maintained)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:21] &lt Lawouach&gt bucker on the other hand isn't really anymore</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:21] &lt Lawouach&gt though it probably still works just as well :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:21] &lt MS-&gt Cool.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:23] &lt MS-&gt I'm currently writing a mail at work to try and get Kamaelia's license changed to something BSD like - probably Apache 2.0 license, and I might use "being compatible with other Kamaelia projects" as a rationale :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:23] &lt MS-&gt (along with other reasons)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:23] &lt MS-&gt since actually I've been asked that by a lot of people really</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:24] &lt MS-&gt (well, alot is relative, but... :) )</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:24] &lt Lawouach&gt I saw that</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:24] &lt Lawouach&gt BSD is the real deal :p</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:24] &lt Lawouach&gt bucker seems to work just fine</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:26] &lt MS-&gt Well, yes. BSD is my personal preference. The MIT license seems to be the simplest of all really, but clause 5 of the Apache license is really handy:</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:27] &lt MS-&gt  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:29] &lt Lawouach&gt right</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:47] &lt MS-&gt OK, asking the legal people first if they have any objections.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:47] &lt MS-&gt The fact that the BBC's released more than one project under the apache license (which I've pointed out) SHOULD mean they don't have any.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:53] &lt MS-&gt Means that also given it's not on the workplan at work, and the fact that I don't work on it during work time (unless I'm using it for a project of course...)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:53] &lt MS-&gt it is then fairer to everyone else (including me :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:56] &lt Lawouach_&gt MS-: good</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:56] &lt MS-&gt It's why I personally prefer the BSD license family in general really - everyone ends up with the same rights, abilities, and most importantly, complete lack of headaches :)</td></tr>
