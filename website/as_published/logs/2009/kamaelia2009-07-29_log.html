            <tr><td>[06:36] &lt Lawouach_&gt yes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:36] &lt ms-away&gt Wow, excellent! :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:36] &lt Lawouach_&gt Kamaelia wasn't actually a problem at all BTW</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:36] &lt Lawouach_&gt It took me a couple of days to port my XML parser to Jython</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:36] &lt ms-away&gt Cool :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:36] &lt Lawouach_&gt I didn't want to change the XMPP/Kamaelia layer</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:36] &lt Lawouach_&gt yes it's very cool</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:36] *** ms-away nods</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:37] &lt ms-away&gt That is very cool to hear.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:37] &lt Lawouach_&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:37] &lt Lawouach_&gt I have tested with the latest Jython trunk</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:37] &lt Lawouach_&gt I can't tell if it works with the latest stable release</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:38] &lt ms-away&gt Even so though, that's one huge milestone as far as I'm concerned. A large funky library by someone not me that runs on top of K running on top of Jython</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:38] &lt ms-away&gt That's amazingly cool :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:39] &lt ms-away&gt Congrats :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:40] &lt Lawouach_&gt ta :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:41] &lt Lawouach_&gt Jython has come a long way I guess since I can also run CherryPy with it (apart from a minor patch tpo apply that will probably make it to the CP trunk soon)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:42] &lt Lawouach_&gt what this means to me immediately is that I can keep using most of my code at work in a context where I thought I'd have to drop it in favor of Java</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:42] &lt Lawouach_&gt Now it looks I'm good to go with Jython instead</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:42] &lt Lawouach_&gt that is sweet music to me</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:42] &lt ms-away&gt That really is cool to hear</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:43] &lt Lawouach_&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:43] &lt ms-away&gt You've probably noticed that I'm slowly merging Jason's code at the moment as well. And whilst it needs a bit of hacking around to make it generally useful,</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:43] &lt Lawouach_&gt That's good to hear</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:43] &lt ms-away&gt the fact it supports your XMPP code & cherry py etc as well should make an interesting test</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:43] &lt ms-away&gt as well</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:43] &lt Lawouach_&gt I can understand it's a tedious task</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:44] &lt Lawouach_&gt indeed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:44] &lt ms-away&gt Well, it's written in such an *odd* style :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:44] &lt ms-away&gt I understand what he was doing clearly now though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:44] &lt ms-away&gt and seperating it out as an app has made everything go alot smoother</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:44] &lt Lawouach_&gt cool</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:45] &lt ms-away&gt I'm still smiling about your code running on Jython btw :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:47] &lt Lawouach_&gt uh uh :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:48] &lt Lawouach_&gt Yeah, I was pleased as well to see that, aside from that XML parser, it just ran</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:48] &lt ms-away&gt I'm pretty surprised tbh, but it's really cool.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt Lawouach_&gt Regarding the parser, Java SAX parser doesn't support the feed(chunk) method that allows to keep parsing more incoming data</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt ms-away&gt I saw your frustrated comment about that</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt Lawouach_&gt so I ended up doing something that would perform that task atop their XML pull parser</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt Lawouach_&gt I'm stubborn :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt ms-away&gt :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt Lawouach_&gt I dislike when technology gets into my way</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:50] &lt ms-away&gt likewise</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:50] &lt Lawouach_&gt The current solution I wrote seems good enough to me even though it might not be the most efficient. It doesn't bother me because it works :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:53] &lt ms-away&gt Well, I always think a working solution is the most important first step anyway. You then just worry about if it's fast enough after all.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[07:33] &lt ms-away&gt Thinking about it, if kamaelia *IS* running cleanly on Jython, then it makes writing a threaded chassis much much more important</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:39] &lt ms-away&gt It'd mean that your "optimisation" phase could simply be more CPUs in a machine ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:41] &lt Lawouach_&gt I like that idea ;)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:41] &lt ms-away&gt It's more cost effective too if you think about it :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:01] &lt MS-&gt That said, I have a working Do/repeat/If statement</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[14:40] &lt MS-&gt I do so like the fact that all components have a unique id that includes their full name. One of the better decisions I made a long time ago :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[14:41] &lt MS-&gt (looking at some updating stuff, and seeing all the numbers change next to the fully qualified component names is nice)</td></tr>
