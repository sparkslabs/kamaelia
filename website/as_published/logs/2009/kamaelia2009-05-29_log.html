            <tr><td>[10:16] &lt MS-&gt got my two test books through today :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:17] &lt MS-&gt Summary of initial reaction : Colour version is much nicer for stuff with pictures, and prints photographs surprisingly well. (esp considering it's the poor cousin to their photobooks)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:17] &lt MS-&gt Black and white version feels more professional due to better binding at that number of pages. (84 out of a maximum of 88)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:17] &lt MS-&gt Other stuff: my margins need to be bigger :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:17] &lt vmlemon_&gt Cool</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:18] &lt MS-&gt I also think that it'd make a really nice little addition to a tutorial. The quality is really nice.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:18] &lt vmlemon_&gt That was "quick"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:18] &lt vmlemon_&gt At least after you gave them a gentle shove</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:18] &lt MS-&gt I think they were having issues with the colour one - the cover is a little botched</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:19] &lt MS-&gt but only on the back on one corner</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:20] &lt MS-&gt The only problem with lulu really is the delivery charge - the cost of making/ordering the black and white version was £1.89, and the colour £8.78, but delivery was £7.30 - so it only makes sense if you're</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:21] &lt MS-&gt either buying lots of one thing (since the delivery appears to be the same either way), or something relatively expensive</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:22] *** vmlemon_ wonders if they expect people to be placing bulk orders constantly </td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:22] &lt MS-&gt I find it interesting though that a 250 page black and white book would be about £3 to get printed, but if it's a computing book would be £30.99 in the shops</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:22] &lt MS-&gt (based on wandering through waterstones the other day)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:23] &lt vmlemon_&gt Heh, the computing content must magically increase the printing cost, or something like that</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:24] &lt MS-&gt Well, the cost of a decent editor does tend to matter, but for getting a printed reference, finding something "OK", and just getting it printed via lulu would be a good budget option.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:25] &lt vmlemon_&gt Yeah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:25] *** vmlemon_ wonders how long he'd have to use an application for, to displace the Windows stats on Wakoopa (currently at 3 weeks, 2 days, 15 hours, 32 minutes and 12 seconds (combined?) - 94% of use) vs some insignificant amount for the Linux version (I've only used it for 14 minutes)</td></tr>
