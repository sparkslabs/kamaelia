            <tr><td>[19:09] &lt MS-&gt Finally got a chance to reply to erisian on the list about his/her implementation in D</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:31] &lt MS-&gt So if that happens, this is just an FYI</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:32] &lt MS-&gt That said, I doubt there's any issue with it :)</td></tr>
