            <tr><td>[17:47] &lt MS-&gt btw, found myself wondering 2 things today. 1) what happens if I rewrite the hackysack implementation in pyrex 2) Would a compiled (ie pyrex based) implementation of Axon be a good idea. (ie a cAxon as an optimisation)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:47] &lt MS-&gt (falling back to python based if no cAxon is available)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:56] &lt Lawouach&gt Personally I dislike that idea</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:57] &lt Lawouach&gt For the good reason that it makes it non portable and ultimately you become less confident in the pure Python performances (as one might then consider it as a poor workaround)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:58] &lt Lawouach&gt BTW, what are the performance target you want to achieve?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:58] &lt Lawouach&gt If a pure python solution is close to stackless performances I'd say it's good enough for my taste.</td></tr>
