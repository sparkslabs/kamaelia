            <tr><td>[17:54] &lt eikenberry&gt Why isn't there a debian package anymore?</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[17:55] &lt vmlemon_&gt I assume that no-one can be bothered to make one, or they've exceeded their Round Tuit quota for the time being</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:55] &lt eikenberry&gt hmm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:58] &lt eikenberry&gt Makes one hesitant to make anything dependent on it though.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:59] &lt eikenberry&gt How to others do it... make it a sub-module of their app and maintain it as part of it?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:59] &lt eikenberry&gt I guess that's the only way to ensure full-cross platform support.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:00] &lt eikenberry&gt Just a hard habit to break... there's a debian package for practically everything.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:27] &lt MS-&gt I don't use debian, and no one who does has offered to make & maintain a package</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:27] &lt MS-&gt Someone did make some debs a few years back, but since I don't use debian it's hard to maintain support for it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:27] &lt eikenberry&gt cool. I might down the road... need to get an investment first. That is I want to use it on something non-play first.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:28] &lt MS-&gt Any offer is greatly appreciated fwiw :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:28] &lt eikenberry&gt I was mainly just curious.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:28] &lt MS-&gt indeed :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:28] &lt MS-&gt like many q's there's often a simple answer</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:28] &lt eikenberry&gt Hopefully. I like what I've used so far. :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:29] &lt MS-&gt I'm pleased to hear that :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:30] &lt MS-&gt When the new ubuntu release is made final I may test it on a netbook I have (which I share with my wife for when we go anywhere for work).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:31] &lt MS-&gt If that supports all the hardware cleanly (my primary motivation for any distro), then that may well shift over from SuSE.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:31] &lt MS-&gt ... and may be close enough for building debian packages</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:34] &lt eikenberry&gt I have an HP netbook... ubuntu worked fine on it.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:35] &lt eikenberry&gt Though I've sense switched to debian.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:36] &lt MS-&gt This is an acer aspire one, which has issues with distros due to the atheros chipset. At the end of the day two things annoy (me) with a distro - broken hardware, and software upgrade irritations.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:36] &lt MS-&gt The former is more annoying :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:36] *** eikenberry nods.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:36] &lt MS-&gt It's always been my guiding factor in choosing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:37] &lt eikenberry&gt the hp has a broadcom chip.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:37] &lt eikenberry&gt had to build the module for it on debian... I think ubuntu had it built-in.</td></tr>
