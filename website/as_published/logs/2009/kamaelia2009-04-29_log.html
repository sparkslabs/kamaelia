            <tr><td>[08:46] &lt MS--&gt ie it should call .stop() on all components.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:54] &lt MS--&gt Early versions of the scheduler were designed such that instead of simply catching StopIteration and removing the component, that they would catch everything and remove the component. ie not crash</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:54] &lt MS--&gt That was at a much earlier stage though, when it was useful for debugging the system</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:55] &lt MS--&gt Naturally that was a problem with KeyboardInterrupt as well</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:55] &lt MS--&gt so that led to the decision to simply catch StopIteration and then left I guess</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:56] &lt MS--&gt I think we're probably getting to the stage where resilience in servers/etc is preferable over debugging - especially given it's clearer how you would insert that.</td></tr>
