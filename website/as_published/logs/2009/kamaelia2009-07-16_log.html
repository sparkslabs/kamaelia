            <tr><td>[17:39] &lt MS-&gt I'm OK with doing it, just wanted to let you know I'm doing this - in case you wanted to watch the checkin notes to see the sorts of things I'm changing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:39] &lt MS-&gt ie in case you're curious more than anything :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:39] &lt MS-&gt Easiest way to see this sort of thing BTW is via here: http://code.google.com/p/kamaelia/source/list</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:40] &lt Davbo&gt cool, pleased to hear it anyway</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[17:41] &lt MS-&gt The branch will also need to be duplicated before merge and deleted, because of the way the branch was made I think.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:41] &lt MS-&gt but that's a minor detail</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:43] &lt Davbo&gt I made a little note of an attribution for those icons btw</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:43] &lt MS-&gt I saw that. It's that sort of thing as well which I'm tidying up</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[17:44] &lt Davbo&gt yeah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:44] &lt Davbo&gt thought that was a nice bit of code</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:45] &lt MS-&gt Indeed, but unknown licensing, so we need to handle it outside the packaging tree - cf : http://code.google.com/p/kamaelia/source/browse/branches/private_DK_PaintDev/Apps/GSOCPaint/</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:45] &lt Davbo&gt ah i see</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:45] &lt MS-&gt I know that the author wouldn't mind, having been around the pygame list for a long time, it's good to sort things out seperately</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:45] &lt Davbo&gt any word from the beeb about relicensing?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:46] &lt MS-&gt I've got a good working relationship with the BBC's lawyers, which helps, so I've asked the question, and had acknowledgement that they'll look at it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:46] &lt MS-&gt Likewise they also respect my knowledge around open source</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:47] &lt MS-&gt I'm not rushing them on it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:47] &lt MS-&gt I'd *like* it to be done in a couple/few weeks</td></tr>
