            <tr><td>[09:35] &lt MS-&gt Seems reasonable on their part</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:36] &lt MS-&gt I think my view is not to be a part of GSOC directly this year. If people come along and ask "hey, can I be mentored, even though I'm not on GSOC" then I'll happily do that</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:36] &lt MS-&gt ... to the same level of assistance</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:38] &lt MS-&gt But, not get involved a third year running. None of the ex-students have turned into continuing contributors. Without them doing that, then just taking on more code ownership which has a high level of technical debt seems mad.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:42] &lt MS-&gt ... and then the students wonder why their code doesn't get merged. (When they put zero effort into making it mergeable)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:43] &lt MS-&gt *shrug* that sounds like bitching I suppose, but it's not meant that way</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:44] &lt MS-&gt Given that, releasing the resource back to the GSOC pool makes the most sense of all</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:56] &lt MS-&gt I think there's alot of things that people could do, but to be frank, I don't think we'll get any students wanting to do the things that matter really</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:58] &lt MS-&gt There's also the time mis-match thing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:59] &lt MS-&gt It's far easier for students to create a very large amount of code in an un-mergeable, non-reviewable manner</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:59] &lt MS-&gt very very quickly</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:59] &lt MS-&gt simply because they can focus all their time on it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:00] &lt MS-&gt Reining that back in requires them to be willing to listen and willing to change their code - for example "don't call methods on components from outside"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:01] &lt MS-&gt ho hum</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:02] &lt MS-&gt If any of last year's students happen to read this (due to logs) probably worth bearing in mind that it's not a criticism of any student's work.</td></tr>
