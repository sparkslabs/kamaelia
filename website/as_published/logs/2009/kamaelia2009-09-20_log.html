            <tr><td>[13:12] &lt MS-&gt The idea is to try and keep as many people happy as possible.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:13] &lt MS-&gt I'd prefer a BSD-like license personally, but I didn't have as much of a choice as I'd like</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:13] &lt MS-&gt Though it's possible we may move to something like apache at some point.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:14] &lt MS-&gt The only foible with the LGPL is that you can argue that inheritance triggers the LGPL, but with python, that inheritance is at runtime.</td></tr>
