            <tr><td>[11:19] &lt MS-&gt vmlemon_: Let's put it this way, that "diversity" list was the single most hostile place I've been in</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:20] &lt MS-&gt Lots of sane people, and lots of people who'd clearly experienced prejudice of some kind for some reason (which I think many have actually)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:20] &lt MS-&gt But for some reason saw people saying things or worse not saying things as heinous crimes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:21] &lt MS-&gt The end point for me was someone deciding to continue that tone by saying "being nice doesn't work"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:21] &lt MS-&gt which I find counter intuitive</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:21] &lt MS-&gt (he says being nice about it :) )</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:21] &lt vmlemon_&gt You'd think that they'd at least try and keep it congenial, given the topic at hand</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:23] &lt MS-&gt Indeed.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:23] &lt MS-&gt One guy was trying to apologise for being blind about something he'd said</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:23] &lt MS-&gt and in the process said something else which upset people</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:23] &lt MS-&gt You know, like the monty python stoning scene from life of brian</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:23] &lt vmlemon_&gt If I was in a minority (for want of a better word), I'd probably want to run a mile from that list</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:23] &lt MS-&gt Everyone's in some minority or another</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:23] &lt vmlemon_&gt I hate to think about the Accessibility mailing lists, of some projects, if the Python equivalent is *that* bad</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:23] &lt vmlemon_&gt True...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:24] &lt MS-&gt I grew up in a poor family and am now only in a better position because I learnt to program and put myself through uni, in order to get a bit of paper in order to get a better job to get to where I am</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:25] &lt MS-&gt That means I'm in a minority much like some others</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:25] &lt MS-&gt But I'm white and male, therefore in the majority group in python</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:25] &lt MS-&gt But I have a beard so I get profiled at airports</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:25] &lt vmlemon_&gt That's the snag - experience means next to nothing, and it's hard on people who haven't been to university yet, and have never been employed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:25] &lt MS-&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:25] &lt vmlemon_&gt Ugh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:26] &lt MS-&gt (a beard is something you can run a control on :) )</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:26] &lt vmlemon_&gt It doesn't help that the economy's in the crapper, and everyone + cat and dog are being shipped off to Bangalore, either</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:27] &lt vmlemon_&gt Aye</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:28] &lt vmlemon_&gt I'm not exactly part of a wealthy "family" (to use the term loosely, given by how fragmented and disjointed mine is), either</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:29] &lt MS-&gt I wanted to raise that sort of issue on the list actually</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:29] &lt vmlemon_&gt It's more of a composite of at least 3 or 4</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:30] &lt MS-&gt but realised I was afraid to speak there so decided to go elsewhere</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:30] &lt MS-&gt For example costs of things like books etc are huge</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:30] &lt MS-&gt "oh just buy..."</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:30] &lt vmlemon_&gt Makes sense. Just when you think someone (in the collective sense) is listening and being accepting, they drop a bomb and plug their ears</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:31] &lt MS-&gt Whereas 25 years ago computer books were written for and accessible by kids</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:31] &lt MS-&gt and in pocket money price range</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:31] &lt MS-&gt Online resources are around now, but it's just not the same</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:31] &lt vmlemon_&gt Of course, it's difficult to comprehend something as complex as a modern computer system now, along with all the proprietary cruft and baggage</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:32] &lt vmlemon_&gt Hell, there aren't even as many people who understand x86 Assembler, so it seems, these days</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:32] &lt MS-&gt That's laziness on behalf of the computing industry, IMO</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:32] &lt MS-&gt I never did x86 assembler</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:32] &lt MS-&gt 6502 & 68000 yes, but not x86 :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:33] &lt MS-&gt I could read Z80 :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:33] &lt vmlemon_&gt It's a case of "I don't understand it, I'll pile a ton of cack on top, and give it a fancy name"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:33] &lt vmlemon_&gt *so I'll</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:33] &lt vmlemon_&gt (Sort-of like Java) ;)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:34] &lt vmlemon_&gt Nothing personal against the people who built and designed Java mind you, but that seems to have been the prevailing mindset</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:37] &lt MS-&gt Dunno. In other news, this amuses:</td></tr>
