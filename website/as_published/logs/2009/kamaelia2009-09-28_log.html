            <tr><td>[09:24] &lt MS-&gt kamlogbot and kamaelia.org may well be moving host at some point soon</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:25] &lt MS-&gt The machine which kamaelia.org is on at the moment will be disconnected at the beginning of next year, and at present I don't know if it will be reconnected when its move completes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:25] &lt MS-&gt as a result I'm testing the VM facilities provided by gandi.net</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:26] &lt MS-&gt Since it seems very reasonably priced</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:28] &lt MS-&gt by reasonably priced, it appears that will allow serving of up to about 3TB a month for £20 per month</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:30] &lt Lawouach_&gt right</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:30] &lt Lawouach_&gt you should contact Rémi @ WebFaction</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:30] &lt Lawouach_&gt they have a great web hosting and I think you've met Rémi</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:31] &lt MS-&gt I have met him - nice guy :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:31] &lt Lawouach_&gt he is</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:31] &lt Lawouach_&gt I spent sometimes at his place last month</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:31] &lt MS-&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:31] &lt Lawouach_&gt anyway, WebFaction really has great service</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:32] &lt Lawouach_&gt without trying to oversell it :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:32] &lt MS-&gt i really should've thought about them.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:32] &lt Lawouach_&gt I'm using gandi only for my domain names</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:32] &lt Lawouach_&gt I can't comment on their web hosting facility</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:32] &lt MS-&gt The only reason I looked at gandi was because I was looking at the domain names I own there :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:32] &lt MS-&gt And noticed that they have virtual server hosting too, and curiosity got me :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:34] &lt Lawouach_&gt i see :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:34] &lt MS-&gt They don't lock you in for a long time though, so I may also look at web faction too.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:34] &lt Lawouach_&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:34] &lt MS-&gt We're likely to be moving house soon too, so shifting my home servers onto gandi would be cost effective.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:35] &lt MS-&gt Since I could switch our home ISP from plus.net to sky, and get an overall reduction in cost and increased serving capacity :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:35] &lt MS-&gt I'll have a play with stuff</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:37] &lt Lawouach_&gt Okay</td></tr>
