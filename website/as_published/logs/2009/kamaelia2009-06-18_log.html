            <tr><td>[06:05] &lt MS-&gt morning</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:28] &lt Lawouach_&gt you're gonna make me feel bad with your diet mate :)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[06:39] &lt MS-&gt I realised a couple of months back that my BMI approaching 35 (it'd just tipped over 34) was a v bad thing, and decided to do something about it.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:43] &lt Lawouach_&gt yeah mine must be 28/29</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:44] &lt MS-&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:44] &lt MS-&gt I'd be very pleased to get down to that level :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:47] &lt Lawouach_&gt Health wise it's still too high</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:47] &lt MS-&gt I'm about 4 months from that I think, based on my stats (tracking loss in a spreadsheet)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:47] &lt MS-&gt Well, yes, but it's still better :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:47] &lt Lawouach_&gt and feeling wise, well, one is never happy with what one has</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:47] *** MS- nods</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:48] &lt Lawouach_&gt mind you, most of my friends reaching the age of 30 seem to gain in weight anyway</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:48] &lt Lawouach_&gt so my feelings aren't so bad :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:48] &lt MS-&gt heh. I think it's a common thing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt MS-&gt Up to 25-30, most people's metabolism self regulates well</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt MS-&gt post 30 it self-regulates worse</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt Lawouach_&gt yeah, it's because one of the protein our body produces to regulate our metabolism stops at 30</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:50] &lt Lawouach_&gt so everybody takes on weight then</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:50] &lt Lawouach_&gt indeed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:51] &lt MS-&gt The primary change I've made to my diet fwiw, is twofold</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:51] &lt MS-&gt firstly I snack (ie small portions) on protein rich foods when I'm hungry</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:51] &lt MS-&gt That's due to some research that says that protein acts as an appetite suppressant</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:51] &lt MS-&gt Means that snacking does stop me feeling hungry - means if I'm hungry I can eat :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:52] &lt MS-&gt second change is to just eat stuff that would be relatively easily accessible to someone most of the year round, and potentially eatable raw.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:52] &lt MS-&gt That does limit my fruit intake (since that would be rare year round normally)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:53] &lt MS-&gt It also limits eating of root vegetables and grain etc since they're rarely edible raw</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:54] &lt MS-&gt But any meat, fish, salad, nut, peanut, type thing is fair game, but focussed on a chunk of protein first, then lighter stuff</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:54] &lt MS-&gt Also, I'm not being dogmatic about it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:54] *** Uraeus_ has joined #kamaelia</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:54] &lt MS-&gt Having one diet coke a week doesn't mean you lose weight, and conversely one ice cream or similar a week doesn't really break a diet</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:55] *** MS- stops being boring about diet :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:55] &lt Lawouach_&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:55] &lt MS-&gt Should write a book on it and put it on lulu.com when I'm done</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:55] &lt Lawouach_&gt dieting is hard, let's go shopping</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:55] &lt MS-&gt Make a fortune or something</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:55] &lt MS-&gt hehe</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:03] &lt Lawouach_&gt :p</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:05] &lt Lawouach_&gt I had watched that Jamie Oliver program last autumn where he goes to a town up North I think to try to educate folks about cooking well</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:05] &lt MS-&gt Yeah, but they'd all want to smack him</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:05] &lt MS-&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:06] &lt Lawouach_&gt yeah :p</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:06] &lt Lawouach_&gt Mind you it was an eye opening to me</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:06] &lt Lawouach_&gt People may be lazy but it's much more profound IMO</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:07] &lt Lawouach_&gt People also lack of time, motivation, money to actually change their habit</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:07] &lt Lawouach_&gt as much as you want to smack him, he shows it like it is</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:08] &lt MS-&gt Maybe - I don't tend to watch things with him in because I find him so annoying :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:09] &lt MS-&gt The problems with losing weight is that it does cost more time and more money, and when you're really tired due to stress or overwork</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:09] &lt MS-&gt finding the time & energy is really hard</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:10] &lt Lawouach_&gt Well the problem wetsern countries have reached is that they must put so much time and money into it *because* they've let it slip for decades before</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:11] &lt Lawouach_&gt And Western countries are fantastic machines when it comes down to alienate and pressurise people in a subtle or not so subtle manner</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:12] &lt MS-&gt I'm not so sure about that, actually - about the "letting it slip" thing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:12] &lt Lawouach_&gt In other words: "you're fat, it's your fault. Now do something about it" is what they say</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:12] &lt MS-&gt The cheapest way to eat, in the west is also the worst for weight & diet.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:12] &lt MS-&gt Then you're right about the "you're fat, your fault" point</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:13] &lt Lawouach_&gt yes indeed. The fact you have to pay more to eat well isn't new. Our ancestor during middle age had the same trouble</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:13] &lt MS-&gt true</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:13] &lt Lawouach_&gt so nothing our civilised society as actually improved :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:13] &lt Lawouach_&gt it's easier to eat everyday, but still we eat poorly</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:14] &lt Lawouach_&gt teh sad thing is costs so much to everyone in the end (healthcare wise :/)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:14] &lt MS-&gt It's really bizarre though when you start looking at stuff</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:15] &lt MS-&gt For example, a pint of milk or couple of liters of water costs less (by half) than all the "lunch" drinks in the small supermarket near the office.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:15] &lt MS-&gt And the cheapest sandwiches there cost more than a packet of precooked chicken.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:15] &lt Lawouach_&gt marketing is the king in our age</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:16] &lt MS-&gt But it's harder to find those things and they're not presented as "lunch foods"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:16] &lt MS-&gt indeed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:16] &lt Lawouach_&gt we're conditionned to eat that bag of crisps rather than eat fresh peas</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:16] &lt MS-&gt I think I last had peas from a pod about 30 years ago :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:16] &lt MS-&gt So I have to agree</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:16] &lt Lawouach_&gt that being said, I don't want to sound like it's not my fault either. I'm a grown man, I should know better... well know I'm trying to find the energy to fight back</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:17] &lt Lawouach_&gt like you do</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:17] &lt Lawouach_&gt and it ain't easy</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:17] &lt MS-&gt It isn't. I think in all of these things there needs to be a trigger.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:17] &lt MS-&gt For me it was my foot hurting (ironically).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:17] &lt Lawouach_&gt heh :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:17] &lt MS-&gt Something minor, but hey psychology is wierd</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[07:18] &lt Lawouach_&gt I can appreciate that</td></tr>
