            <tr><td>[09:56] &lt MS-&gt Yes, it's interesting, but I probably won't be able to talk about it during those 12 weeks, since it relates to a piece of public talking that someone else will be doing</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[09:57] &lt MS-&gt For example actually resolving the issue Jim's mentioned could dramatically simplify how the SubscribeTo components get shutdown :)</td></tr>
