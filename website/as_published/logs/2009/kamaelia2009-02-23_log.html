            <tr><td>[22:34] &lt TheBashar&gt Thank you. That helps. For resource conservation, is there any way to have a single handler listen on all the ports? As apposed to creating a bunch of individual handlers.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:35] &lt MS-&gt Well, under the hood what's really happening is you're creating a socket and each socket in practice only listens to one port</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:35] &lt MS-&gt As a result TCPServer which is the raw component that creates the listener socket only watches one such socket</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[22:36] &lt MS-&gt Well, if you want to send all the inputs on all ports to a single component, then the easiest way to do that is to use a backplane component</td></tr>
