            <tr><td>[06:46] &lt vmlemon_&gt Because *everyone* likes to kanallen of ziggo, or something like that ;)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:46] &lt Rigolo&gt it must be "understandable" at least :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[06:47] &lt Rigolo&gt I am happy with it too ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:48] &lt vmlemon_&gt Seeing as my knowledge of Dutch is so fantastic...ally non-existent ;)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt Rigolo&gt well ... then the credits should go to google to help you understand it :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt vmlemon_&gt Yeah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:49] &lt Rigolo&gt but working more and more with mythtv and open-sasc-ng I get more frustrated with the whole setup ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:50] &lt Rigolo&gt so I think I will just really need to start working on my python skills and see what I can come up with by using Kamaelia</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:50] &lt vmlemon_&gt That's probably why it's called MythTV - there's no such thing as a working configuration (it only exists in fairy-tales) ;)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[06:51] &lt Rigolo&gt but that means writing 2 things .. one is a connection from python to FFdecsa in order to decrypt encrypted channels .. and the other is a link to a newcamd (NewCS) server to get code words from my smartcard in order to be able to decode</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:52] &lt Rigolo&gt and then I probably also need to do something with irdeto coding etc</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:52] &lt vmlemon_&gt Aah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:52] &lt Rigolo&gt so ... as you can see ... lot's of stuff ... and hardly any python experiance ;-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[06:52] &lt vmlemon_&gt Let me guess, there's only one Open Source "reference implementation"? (To use the term extremely loosely)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:53] &lt Rigolo&gt well ... open-sasc-ng source code is available ... and FFdecsa is also fairly well documented</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[06:53] &lt Rigolo&gt first need to see how everything should be connected .. and then take it from there</td></tr>
