            <tr><td>[22:25] &lt MS-&gt ie *documenting* work, is more important than *communicating* work. The latter results in understanding, and potential use</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:26] &lt vmlemon_&gt Hmm, I don't think that'll go down well for Sun - there was supposedly a plan to make advertising supported versions of OpenOffice</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:27] &lt MS-&gt as a the choice of result open/closed code really depends on how much benefit it brings academically</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:27] &lt Davbo&gt MS-: I was looking at a project computer science did a couple of years ago, it was to analyse text to pick out anomalies for the government to catch terrorists saying they were going to "deliver to the ice cream to red house" or something like that</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:27] &lt Davbo&gt you get the idea</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:28] &lt Davbo&gt lets be nice and say that it worked 99% of the time...that is a massive amount of error right there it would be totally unusable</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:29] &lt Davbo&gt they just say that they can do it and get a fat grant from the MOD it's obscene</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:30] &lt Davbo&gt Man, I really couldn't work as an academic if I was doing shit like that</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:32] &lt Davbo&gt I guess you don't agree MS-?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:33] &lt MS-&gt I'm not sure I can read what you mean :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:34] &lt Davbo&gt Sorry, it really annoys me as you can tell.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:37] &lt Davbo&gt Basically, they wanted to analyse text to catch anomalous word useage. For obvious reasons the government had an interest in that research so partly funded it (from what i gather)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:38] &lt Davbo&gt I'd argue that something which did that would need such a low error rate it's totally pointless</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:40] &lt Davbo&gt My point being, sometimes it's far worse than just - "&lt MS-&gt A secondary goal of academic research is the ability to publish more papers, in order to attract funding"</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[22:43] &lt MS-&gt I doubt the people doing that work *didn't* believe it could help/work</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:44] &lt Davbo&gt Yeah I guess, I'd hate to work on something like that though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:44] &lt Davbo&gt which imo is a complete waste of time</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:44] &lt MS-&gt even if you thought you could get it low enough error rate?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:44] &lt MS-&gt what if you decided to have a policy of "zero false positives"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:45] &lt Davbo&gt that would be different</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:45] &lt MS-&gt That would mean you almost certainly miss positives</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:45] &lt Davbo&gt but it would also be neigh impossible</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:45] &lt Davbo&gt well, yeah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:46] &lt Davbo&gt I'm thinking of popping into ARM Sheffield and seeing if they're going to have a summer placement again though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:46] &lt Davbo&gt they're a nice company to work for, from what I've heard</td></tr>
