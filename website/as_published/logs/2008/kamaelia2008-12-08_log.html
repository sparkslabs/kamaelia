            <tr><td>[19:45] &lt vmlemon_&gt You'd have things like spammers and "fly-by-night" users on the outside of the thing, and then work the way in to things like close friends and family members</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:45] &lt vmlemon_&gt Although that does make the assumption that everyone's using it</td></tr>
