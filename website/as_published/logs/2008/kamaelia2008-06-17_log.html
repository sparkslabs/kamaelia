            <tr><td>[21:13] &lt j_baker&gt Well, the only thing I really want to do is make it so that my program can pull configuration data from the zipfile executable before I start doing more thorough testing.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:15] &lt j_baker&gt I would also like to daemonize the program and make it run in a similar fashion to mod_wsgi's "daemon mode" (ie, each program gets its own process), but those are probably further down the road (if they get done at all during GSOC).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:15] &lt j_baker&gt I did have a couple of questions though: 1) I remember you telling me that my wsgi.input environ variable could be vulnerable to a DOS attack (since it uses cStringIO). How would I solve that? Could I use a tempfile, or would that be worse?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:16] &lt j_baker&gt 2) Do you have any advice on what to do to test the program other than to try it with different WSGI apps and stress test it?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:16] &lt MS-&gt The DOS attack really revolves around "what happens if I post 10 1G videos at your server at once"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:17] &lt j_baker&gt Ah. So perhaps there should be a limit on the size of the memory file?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:17] &lt MS-&gt Using a tempfile would help offset that to an extent, but the correct approach is to just not read wsgi.input before you should. For the moment it's best to note it and then deal with it properly in the next version</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:17] &lt MS-&gt You could do that as well, and note that as a limitation.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:18] &lt MS-&gt Regarding 2) I think that the approach you've described is the one I'd look at - since it's a practical approach. I'd also look for a compliance test suite, but fundamentally the only real test is against apps</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:19] &lt MS-&gt I'd suggest 2 particular apps though as worth testing: Django & pylons</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:19] &lt MS-&gt Both should run on top of WSGI and if they run, that should mean that it covers a wide set of problems</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:19] &lt MS-&gt I'd pick the simplest possible apps for each though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:20] &lt j_baker&gt wsgiref has a validator, but I believe my code should already pass it.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:21] &lt MS-&gt regarding stress testing, it's also worth bearing in mind that for personal sites the level of traffic you're likely to get is low per server</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:21] &lt MS-&gt It could be more of an issue for your "intemediary" later on though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:22] &lt MS-&gt But one thing at a time, and at the moment, given the "make it work, make it work right, make it fast" rule of thumb, I'd suggest we're at stage 2</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:22] &lt MS-&gt Since you still have open issues (that you've been raising)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:24] &lt j_baker&gt Ok. Is there also anything I should worry about security-wise? I know that my simple app is probably insecure as hell since it doesn't escape input, but that's more of a test than anything else.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:25] &lt MS-&gt I think at this stage no. What it may be worth doing is going through it and marking the parts that you think need reviewing and adding either</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:41] &lt MS-&gt I'm hoping also (for example) to be able to host my current (day) work ontop of your work, primarily to see if I can move my work's hosted application off the server to client side</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:41] &lt MS-&gt Whether or not that's useful for work is by the by (might well not be), but it would make a very nicer, very real test of your code - since it's a real app</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:44] &lt MS-&gt My work code should be an interesting test in itself because I *am* posting video at the server.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:46] &lt j_baker&gt Heh... well, that will definitely be an optimization challenge when I get to that point. The handler is set up currently to wait for the body in its entirety before it starts working.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:49] &lt MS-&gt That's kinda what I'm aiming for really - the best way to get code working well is once it gets past the "working" and "right" stage is to keep throwing stuff at it that it gets progressively harder for it to keep going</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:50] &lt j_baker&gt True. One thing that I did learn from the book they sent me: it's a good idea to attack the hardest problem first.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:55] &lt MS-&gt Sometimes though you attempt the intractable and just get demoralised and can't move forward - so accepting a partial solution to the hard problem is often a good idea initially</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:58] &lt j_baker&gt Using a garbage collector with C++ is almost like trying to put an engine on a bike IMO. It makes it go faster and easier, but the two just weren't made for each other.</td></tr>
