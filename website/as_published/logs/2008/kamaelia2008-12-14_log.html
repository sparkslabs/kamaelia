            <tr><td>[12:05] &lt MS-&gt which should be interesting given the lack of documentation</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:08] &lt MS-&gt the gsoc2008 branches contained zero information about what was in them, so I've just treated them as tags</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:14] &lt Lawouach&gt I see</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:17] &lt MS-&gt Also, no-one has stuck around to assist with merging their code either.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:17] &lt MS-&gt I've come to the conclusion now that summer of code doesn't achieve its goals and I doubt I'll be participating again</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:18] &lt MS-&gt I thought by saying to people "hey, please come work on something you personally have an interest in" that they'd be encouraged to stick around, but it seems that doesn't work</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:21] &lt MS-&gt Problem is the incentive model is all wrong.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:33] &lt Lawouach&gt Mind you</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:34] &lt Lawouach&gt Perhaps we weren't clear enough about the exact goals of GSoC from the project's perspective</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:34] &lt Lawouach&gt Did we comminucate well enough?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:34] &lt Lawouach&gt I'm honestly asking BTW</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:35] &lt MS-&gt It's not really that, I think GSoC itself is fundamentally flawed, given clay shirky's talk which I linked to on twitter a few weeks back</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:35] &lt Lawouach&gt Because we also explained that we were trying to give the students tools to understand OSS</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:35] *** Lawouach will look for that talk again</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:39] &lt Lawouach&gt That's btw a reason why I've always kept everything I'm doing with Kamaelia outside of it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:39] &lt Lawouach&gt I know I can't commit</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:39] &lt Lawouach&gt At least not that way</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:39] *** MS- nods</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:40] &lt MS-&gt I also realise that the phrase "good intentions" plays a big part here</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:40] &lt Lawouach&gt But then again I'm really wondering if we can be unhappy our students didn't commit considering we never really said it was part of the deal</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:40] &lt MS-&gt But there's the bit in clay shirky's talk about experiments involving 2 groups of volunteers that I think deals with the most</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:41] *** Davbo has good intentions, also has too much happening at home with family to find the time</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:41] &lt MS-&gt Lawouach: I asked every student for the past 2 years about how they'd ensure (at minimum) code maintenance</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:41] &lt Lawouach&gt okay</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:41] &lt MS-&gt Davbo: Indeed - that falls into the category of good intentions</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:42] &lt MS-&gt However, I also have a huge amount going on at home with family and I find the time, which means fundamentally our emotional investment with things is different (which is absolutely fine).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:42] &lt MS-&gt (different people are different)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:42] &lt Davbo&gt whenever I have the time I have other university work to do, even that I've fallen behind with and has started to have a visible impact unfortunately</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:42] &lt Davbo&gt your investment is a different one though MS-</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:42] &lt MS-&gt Davbo: precisely</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:43] &lt MS-&gt And that is also the point</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:43] &lt MS-&gt (which isn't personal to you or any other gsoc student :) )</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:43] &lt MS-&gt It's the old phrase "you can't buy love" that really matters - and in a way that's what gsoc tries to do</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:43] &lt Davbo&gt but hey, I've stuck around and answered a few peoples questions on IRC the best i can</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:44] &lt MS-&gt Davbo: I'm in NO way criticising you or any other gsoc student</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:44] &lt Davbo&gt yeah, i know that but I think GSoC did work on me to a degree</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:44] &lt MS-&gt I prefer to try and understand the over "why doesn't gsoc work and is it worth doing again in future years" rather than go "awww why don't they love me :)"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:44] &lt MS-&gt Davbo: That's cool :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:46] &lt Lawouach&gt MS-: That is very sensible and I share your doubts</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:46] &lt MS-&gt It's also not just gsoc itself btw</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:46] &lt Davbo&gt If they didn't offer the money it would be interesting</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt Davbo&gt they could spend the money on other things to reach out to the correct people</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt MS-&gt There are major aspects of the project's goals/direction which are very difficult to grasp, primarily because I've been a bit crap at explaining them</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt Davbo&gt which right now it doesn't seem to be doing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt MS-&gt It's hit rate is better than zero, which is pretty good.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt MS-&gt But the money aspect does rather break things</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:48] &lt Davbo&gt I'd have still done it, but it wasn't a replacement for a summer job to me, which it was to many I talked to</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:48] &lt MS-&gt If a student doesn't do "good enough" work or totally irrelevant or &lt insert list&gt then the aspect of with-holding the money, is a massively different dynamic from normal</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:49] &lt MS-&gt since rather than just a lack of feedback and lack of merge (ie lack of carrot)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:49] &lt MS-&gt there's an actual stick as well, which doesn't work</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:49] &lt MS-&gt at all</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:50] &lt MS-&gt But it also means that you can't drop someone without that stick being implicitly wielded either</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:50] &lt MS-&gt which is really crap</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:50] &lt Davbo&gt Yeah, i see what you mean</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:50] &lt MS-&gt (especially given as mentors we don't have that incentive/disincentive)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:51] &lt MS-&gt It is very curious almost a classic example of the psych test that Clay Shirky talks about in that test</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:51] &lt MS-&gt in that talk</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:52] &lt MS-&gt non-paid students asked to play & do tasks continue to play afterwards</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:52] &lt MS-&gt paid students asked to do tasks and paid per task, do not play afterwards (or whilst their waiting for new tasks when the person is out the room)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:53] &lt Lawouach&gt I just heard him relating that experience</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:53] *** Davbo has to go hang out washing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:53] &lt Lawouach&gt quite interesting in many ways</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:53] &lt Davbo&gt sorry, brb :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:53] &lt MS-&gt Davbo: have fun - I have to go shopping :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:53] &lt MS-&gt back later :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:53] &lt Lawouach&gt later guys</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[13:47] *** Davbo does his predicate logic homework :(</td></tr>
