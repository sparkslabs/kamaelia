            <tr><td>[15:23] &lt MS-&gt but as it stands, you can't know for certain that .stop() will do what you expect it to - specifically you can't actually expect it to stop the component</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:28] &lt MS-&gt The ideas in the "garbage collector" component (again, another misleading name), made me think that actually have a "stop service"</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:28] &lt MS-&gt could be useful</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:29] &lt Lawouach_&gt Could you explain how that'd work?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:29] &lt Lawouach_&gt on the list if you'd rather BTW :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:29] &lt MS-&gt I think the list is better since it's a little detailed, but mirrors what happens with pygame display etc</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:30] &lt Lawouach_&gt cool</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:30] &lt MS-&gt You'd essentially be able to send to the service - where a service is (component, inbox) - a service (ie (self, someinbox) ) where you'd like shutdownMicroprocess messages sent</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:31] &lt MS-&gt It'd be implemented as a component ("stopper" perhaps, and a mixin)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:31] &lt MS-&gt and to use you'd pull in the mixin and then just register with the shutdown service</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:31] &lt MS-&gt using something like</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:31] &lt MS-&gt or something</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:31] &lt mhrd-home&gt imo there are also at least two different reasons why you'd want to shutdown/stop a system and these feel like they have different requirement: intended shutdown (eg. reaches end of the file its processing) and unexpected termination (eg. error, ctrl-c etc) ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:31] &lt mhrd-home&gt in the former situation I think there's a case for it being under the control of the components in question, so they can finish up and stop cleanly and timely</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:33] &lt MS-&gt nb, while it's made me think a bit further down the route - essentially as a _potentially_ better way of doing that "garbage collector" component, I don't think it would be the "ideal" solution, but maybe a step towards something better</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:33] &lt Lawouach_&gt mhrd-home: I agree and that's what I was saying the other day.</td></tr>
