            <tr><td>[12:10] &lt MS-&gt Yep, government has a 51% ownership stake IIRC</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:11] &lt MS-&gt But they don't get any money from the license fee AIUI, so it's commercially funded, but with a remit of serving minority groups</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:11] &lt MS-&gt Never quite figured out how big brother fits in with that goal myself :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:12] &lt MS-&gt IIRC the original complaint about channel 4 is that its remit is what BBC 2 was set up to do.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:31] &lt vmlemon_&gt I've just figured why they broadcast Big Brother now - it's so naff and unbelievably boring, that a large minority watch it ;)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:32] &lt vmlemon_&gt (So it fits in with their remit goals ;) )</td></tr>
