The essential idea behind it is that the internet is and should be peer to peer.

Thus, KamConnect aims to allow users to host web content on their own computers without having to know much about setting up a</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:39] &lt amnorvend&gt IMPLEMENTATIONS: At its most basic level, KamConnect is made up of an intermediary and a peer component. The intermediary serves to connect two peers without having to interact with DNS (at least not directly). The peer is by default a python script that is responsible for hosting content and directing the user's requests through the intermediary. My goal is to allow the hosted content to be scripted using python in such a way that it's easy for the u</td></tr>
