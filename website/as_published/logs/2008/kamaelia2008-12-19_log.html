            <tr><td>[22:57] &lt MS-&gt vmlemon_: Feel free to reuse. IMO that comes under "good practice" rather than "worrying about licensing" really :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:57] &lt vmlemon_&gt Aah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:58] &lt vmlemon_&gt I ended up pulling the bit off about the AUTHORs file, if I remember correctly, and rearranged an existing header on some modified code to fit, for what it's worth...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[22:59] &lt vmlemon_&gt A bit hacky, but the Kamaelia approach seemed sensible to me, as opposed to cluttering the file up by providing a huge list of names</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[23:06] &lt MS-&gt I can't remember where I saw the approach myself btw</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[23:07] &lt MS-&gt It certainly simplifies things *alot* though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[23:07] &lt vmlemon_&gt I ought to restructure the said implementation, since it's somewhat of a compromise, and it's only applied to modified files right now</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[23:08] &lt vmlemon_&gt Doesn't help that at least 2 or 3 different licenses are used in different files, either</td></tr>
