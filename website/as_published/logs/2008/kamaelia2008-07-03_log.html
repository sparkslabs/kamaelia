            <tr><td>[10:36] &lt mhrd&gt Trun: my (untested) guess is that the creation of the scheduler in background's run() method happens after the other component is activated when the call to start() returns ... ie. a race condition</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:37] &lt mhrd&gt you could remove that problem by overriding the start() method and having it wait for some kind of signalling from the thread to let it know that the thread had created the new scheduler and was ready. only when it receives this signal would it return.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:40] &lt mhrd&gt that's why, for example, there's signalling like that in threadedcomponent - eg. when the thread calls self.link() it won't return until the main thread of execution has signalled back saying that it has been done. Not good for performance, but safe.</td></tr>
