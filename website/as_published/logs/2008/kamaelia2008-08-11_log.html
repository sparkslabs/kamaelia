            <tr><td>[19:17] &lt j_baker&gt Perhaps it would be a better idea to send them out on the same outbox.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:18] &lt j_baker&gt The reason being: what happens if a user logs out and then logs back in before the presence handler can process the message that it logged out?</td></tr>
