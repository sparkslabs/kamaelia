            <tr><td>[10:00] &lt Lawouach_&gt the selector component is simply mapping events from the select module to axon messages</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:02] &lt Lawouach_&gt the OS uses a low level interuption to inform the select module that something happened on a socket</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:03] &lt orphans&gt ok, so it receives interrupts and tells your program do get off it's behind and do something</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:03] &lt Lawouach_&gt the CSA is then used to either read/write on the socket</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:04] &lt orphans&gt yeah, I understand the CSA more than the selector</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:04] &lt Lawouach_&gt you shouldn't really have to understand the selector component</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:05] &lt orphans&gt but if I need to use mhrd's changes I do, cause I have a lot more time to sort out getting it cleaned up and merged :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:05] &lt mhrd&gt ok; iirc there's two sets of things I did there - one related to UDP support, the other is a performance optimisation</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:06] &lt mhrd&gt context: I was trying to increase the efficiency so I could deal with several megabits per second of data - which it wasn't quite up to on the target hardware at the time</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:16] &lt mhrd&gt ok, now I've understood it again whilst talking through it with you; I reckon those optimisations should be pretty much independent of the UDP stuff, so you can probably ignore them :)</td></tr>
