            <tr><td>[12:41] &lt ms-afk&gt so they need to know what level of overhead I'm giving to this sort of thing</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:42] &lt ms-afk&gt Also, you *can* put in more than 20 quarter days into the system, which can flag up when there's problems or time in lieu needed etc</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:43] &lt ms-afk&gt But as matt says it degrades nicely - though I do prefer an accurate log for when the monthly or quarterly (3 monthly) reporting cycle comes round</td></tr>
