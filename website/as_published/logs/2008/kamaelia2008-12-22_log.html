            <tr><td>[18:38] &lt mabdallah&gt great</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:38] &lt vmlemon_&gt (It's always supported DVB-T as far as I know)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:39] &lt vmlemon_&gt Not sure what you'd have to do differently in your code to use a DVB-S card, but it shouldn't involve too many changes</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:39] &lt vmlemon_&gt It's pretty much just the tuning and modulation options that you have to worry about</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:41] &lt mabdallah&gt actually i want to use kamaelia DVB utilities to drive my DVB-S (change channel, capture the stream), is this doable in the current version ?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:42] &lt vmlemon_&gt Certainly</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:42] &lt vmlemon_&gt If I remember correctly, the code was originally designed to handle DVB-S devices, so the mailing list post I'm reading reckons</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:43] &lt vmlemon_&gt There's some sample code, too</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:44] &lt vmlemon_&gt and http://www.kamaelia.org/Cookbook/DVB/TransportStreamCapture should get you started</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:46] &lt vmlemon_&gt You might have to change the constellation setting to dvb3.frontend.QAM_64 or dvb.frontend.QAM_128 if I remember correctly for DVB-S</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:46] &lt vmlemon_&gt depending on the DVB service provider</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:47] &lt vmlemon_&gt Naturally, the frequency would also need changing to suit, and I'm not too sure about the FEC stuff</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:47] &lt vmlemon_&gt I hope that helps</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:50] &lt vmlemon_&gt No problem</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:51] &lt vmlemon_&gt The DVB code in the examples lends itself well to quick reuse, so I've found</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:51] &lt vmlemon_&gt (I've got several versions of one of the examples on my desktop box that deal with different DVB-T multiplexes, and append stuff to the end of files instead of creating new ones, for example)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:52] &lt vmlemon_&gt Although that's pretty much the spirit of Kamaelia</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:57] &lt mabdallah&gt does kamaelia supports converting the transport stream captured from DVB to any other format to save disk space?</td></tr>
