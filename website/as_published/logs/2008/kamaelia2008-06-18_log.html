            <tr><td>[12:08] &lt mhrd&gt running ./Profiling.py is a good case in point about the alck of accuracy: at the time at which the profiler itself gets scheduled, all the other compnoents are asleep. The data it generates subsequently causes them to wake, but then they go back to sleep again by the time the profiler next gets executed by the scheduler</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:09] &lt mhrd&gt threaded components are a big caveat - because the main() is executing in a completely different thread, the profiler will not report useful/accurate info at all ... what it is actually reporting on is the internal wrapper inside threadedcompoennt that is normally hidden</td></tr>
