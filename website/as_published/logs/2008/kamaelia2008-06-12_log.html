            <tr><td>[15:44] &lt ms-&gt I wasn't going to put us forward for GSOC this year as a result, but decided to run this by LH and the GSOC team</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:44] &lt ms-&gt (after all, many projects happen outside work time)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:44] &lt ms-&gt and so were happy for us to be involved :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:45] &lt ms-&gt It's good for everyone really since for me it gives good justification for getting things back on later in the year</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:45] &lt ms-&gt since that participate project is an external commitment by the department that finishes this year</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:46] &lt ms-&gt Hence I was interested in application project areas that expand the codebase into lots more interesting areas that people were interested in working on for their own personal benefit :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:46] &lt j_baker&gt It's pretty cool that Leslie did that. But I suppose that's also one of the points of GSOC.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:47] &lt Uraeus&gt Davbo: be aware that most 20% time for own projects ends up being empty air in practice. I know a lot of people at Google, almost none of who ever actually get around to those 20%. Problem is that when working on an important project with a deadline, taking a day to work on a private project might be something your contract allows, but it is not socially acceptable</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:47] &lt ms-&gt I suppose the other thing though is it's a demonstrator that I'm really not doing this because anyone's asking me to - it's because I really believe this will be a better way of writing code, and a way that we need to make easier for everyone</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:47] &lt vmlemon_&gt Anyone think we'd see BSkyB Open Source any time soon? ;)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:48] &lt ms-&gt since otherwise we'll all get to 8/16 core machines and people will get worse and worse software</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:49] &lt vmlemon_&gt All software is going that way, sadly</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:49] &lt Davbo&gt I suppose that's why it *seems* like a good idea Uraeus but you don't see it much/hear much about it.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:49] &lt ms-&gt Nah, regarding multithreaded/etc software on 8/16 core systems, they can't really be blamed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:49] &lt j_baker&gt Writing parallel apps in windows is just a pain.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:50] &lt ms-&gt The problem is that people get trained to use things like threads without being told how to use them safely</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:50] &lt j_baker&gt I think it would be interesting to port Kamaelia to C#. :)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:52] &lt ms-&gt Our course was also entertaining in that every module had a significant labs content which everyone had to do</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:52] &lt vmlemon_&gt It's great that we have machines with more power than an early Cray, but not that the code running on them is slower/less efficient than that on even really old machines</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:52] &lt ms-&gt and every labs session had a maximum mark that could be obtained of 70% *if you only did the things requested*</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:58] &lt ms-&gt Well, the reason why I think that games programming can be a good one is because it can be an interesting domain</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[16:01] &lt Davbo&gt That's the problem with "Game Development" degree's they could be easily as technical as Computer Science but due to a lot of Universities treating them like joke degree's they tend to just be a course on simple C++</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[17:35] &lt ms-&gt I think the word request needs clarifying btw in your mails - you seem to have an assumption regarding something which I don't understand, and I think I need to in order to answer whatever question you're asking is :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:19] &lt j_baker&gt That's handled by the HTTPServer I'm assuming.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:21] &lt ms-&gt Not bad - it presumes that you call all things that manage protocols " handlers " and there is that problem as well</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:22] &lt ms-&gt http://edit.kamaelia.org/Docs/NotationForVisualisingAxon - shows visually what's going on somewhat better</td></tr>
