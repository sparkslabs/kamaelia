            <tr><td>[18:13] &lt j_baker&gt Ok. I suppose a more general question is how do I go about determining if the trouble I may have packaging a dependency is worth the time I'd spend writing my own code?</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:14] &lt j_baker&gt Or would the packaging trouble usually be minimal?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:18] &lt Lawouach&gt Hmm. The packaging is minimal in the sense you wouldn't have selector part of your application, would you?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:18] &lt Lawouach&gt Let me rephrase</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:18] &lt Lawouach&gt do you plan on having something along a setup module that'd configure your application up</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:18] &lt Lawouach&gt And could go and grab the requirements</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:19] &lt Lawouach&gt or would you provide them along with the application?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:20] &lt j_baker&gt Well, I would like the server to be easy to configure out of the box, but I'm also planning on setting up a package manager of some kind that could do that. So I suppose I could do either one.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:21] &lt Lawouach&gt You decide then :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:21] &lt Lawouach&gt There are advantages in both methods</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:22] &lt Lawouach&gt The advantage of fetching requirements at runtime is that the application package will be smaller</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:22] &lt Lawouach&gt The drawback is that you'll have to ensure you fetch the proper version</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:23] &lt j_baker&gt Ok. That makes total sense. I suppose I'll have to do a little research then. Selector looks pretty interesting though.</td></tr>
