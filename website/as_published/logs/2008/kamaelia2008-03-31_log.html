            <tr><td>[19:55] &lt j_baker&gt Ideally install the package, maybe do some configuration if you're behind a NAT, and then go to a webpage to put up your content.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[19:56] &lt Lawouach&gt that clears the deployment of it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:56] &lt j_baker&gt For example, ms- suggested that I may use Cerenity, but I was also thinking about something like MoinMoin</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:57] &lt Lawouach&gt now could you drive me the "go to a webpage and put up your ocntent bit"?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:58] &lt j_baker&gt Well for instance if I use Cerenity, if you go to a page that doesn't exist, you get a prompt to create the page and a form to do so.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:59] &lt j_baker&gt It may require some modification to make it a bit more user friendly, but the software supports the basic idea.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:00] &lt j_baker&gt I would like some time to evaluate the different packages that are out there and evaluate how they fit into the project before I commit to too much though.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:01] &lt j_baker&gt In that regard, is the info I've provided you (at least here in chat) sufficient to clear up how that would work, or is there something else that I should flesh out?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:02] &lt Lawouach&gt considering Google has offered more time for evaluation I would appreciate if you could draw some sketch of a use case and post it online</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:04] &lt j_baker&gt Yup. I was going to try to spend the time between now and when coding starts to do some of that.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:05] &lt j_baker&gt I was thinking about Cerenity or MoinMoin simply because they seem to be the most lightweight options.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:10] &lt victorultimus&gt Pardon me for being slow, and off topic, but on the Ideas page in the section about a video conferencing tool, I understand everything there but the first sentence referring to "wrapping" some "bindings". Yes those two words. Would someone be so kind to breifly explain?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:12] &lt orphans&gt victorultimus: basically you wrap a library which is written in some other language (c/c++ normally?) to allow you to access it in python</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:13] &lt orphans&gt the thing which is produced after the wrapping process which lets you call the code is the binding</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:13] &lt victorultimus&gt Ah, ok. That makes since.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:13] &lt victorultimus&gt sense</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:15] &lt victorultimus&gt Fun, you say?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:15] &lt orphans&gt I had a bit of a look at this - cross-platform camera libraries are hard to come by</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:16] &lt orphans&gt theres a few for windows, and a few for linux and a few for osx. Maybe even a couple for two of the three</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:17] &lt victorultimus&gt So you're basically talking going on some sort of Google quest (blogs, message boards, the like)?</td></tr>
