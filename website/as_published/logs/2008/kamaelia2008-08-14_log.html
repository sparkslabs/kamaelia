            <tr><td>[13:56] &lt j_baker&gt np... if you get lost, let me know. The way Kamaelia's HTTP server works can be a little bit weird, but it works. And some of my code may add to that confusion.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[14:14] &lt j_baker&gt I think your code is in good shape for the most part, aside from a couple of warts, which every program has. :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:15] &lt orphans&gt j_baker, thanks for the feedback so far btw, it's really useful having someone else looking over it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:15] &lt orphans&gt ty :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:16] &lt j_baker&gt Yeah. Looking back, I think a peer review at midterm would've been useful.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:18] &lt orphans&gt yeah. I guess peoples code was in quite varied states at midterm though - different approaches to it and that</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:22] &lt Davbo&gt Yeah, it would get in the way of people working on their projects too</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[14:46] &lt orphans&gt j_baker, SMELL is slightly better than VOMIT, but slightly worse than FIXME :)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:08] &lt j_baker&gt Lawouach: I'm not sure if you're already aware, but it looks like defuze.org is down. And it looks to me like a "your config file is fubared" type error.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:29] &lt j_baker&gt orphans, I was just saying that I feel that what's in that file may be better suited for a data file of some type. But that's just what I personally would do with that data, so you're free to disagree with me.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:30] &lt orphans&gt just seems a bit overkill really, it's only a small thing which I need to be able to yank values out of</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:31] &lt orphans&gt especially given that I'll never need to alter anything in it - if I did I'd probably take a different route</td></tr>
