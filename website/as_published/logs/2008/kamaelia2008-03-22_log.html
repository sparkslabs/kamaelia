            <tr><td>[14:41] &lt orphans&gt part of the fun would be that each user could then control different sounds with it, so you'd have the same structure and melody, but really different sounds</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:41] &lt MS-&gt I like the idea of it being multiuser as well (should be fairly easy to do that given the way kamaelia hangs together)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[14:50] &lt MS-&gt The question in my mind is what core components this would generate for kamaelia. I guess it would be integration with OSC or midi, neither of which exist at present, and would be potentially a fun project</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:50] &lt orphans&gt ahh, so perhaps using the webcam to make a physical interface for it too. I was thinking more purely digital, but I guess that could kill three birds with one stone. In a kind of stretched metaphor...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:51] &lt orphans&gt yeah, that was in a way what I wasn't sure about. I think something like OSC could potentially be pretty useful</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:51] &lt MS-&gt I think doing that *and* webcam integration could be attempting too much for GSOC, but having that as an added extra sounds a realistic possibility. (*IF* webcam support is trivial, or if someone else does that as a project )</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:52] &lt orphans&gt yeah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:53] &lt orphans&gt Looking at the list OSC would be one way to link to processing (which has pretty good support for it) - I could maybe focus more in that direction if it's more of interest to you</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:54] &lt orphans&gt Perhaps even use processing for a UI</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:54] &lt MS-&gt processing is less interesting since that's java based really.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:54] &lt MS-&gt The kamaelia/jython/processing project suggestion is more around the idea of pushing kamaelia into a web browser environment</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[14:55] &lt orphans&gt ahh k, yeah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:56] &lt MS-&gt I figured you meant this would build on the whiteboard codebase (maybe) since that already handles a collaborative UI</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:56] &lt MS-&gt Where clients can all connect to each other in a P2P fashion</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:56] &lt MS-&gt Which would mean you could focus on the other aspects</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:57] &lt MS-&gt hm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:57] &lt orphans&gt yeah, perhaps. To be honest I hadn't really thought as far as a UI - more the idea of the OSC/Midi communication with some form of UI</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:57] &lt MS-&gt I wonder if Matt's nascent gesture recognition code could be useful for this sort of thing</td></tr>
