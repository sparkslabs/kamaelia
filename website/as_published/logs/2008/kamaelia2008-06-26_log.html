            <tr><td>[09:00] &lt Lawouach_&gt for one, Joe has considered quite sensibly it'd make a good fit for Axon rather than Kamaelia.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:00] &lt Lawouach_&gt I can see why he made such a choice</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:00] &lt Lawouach_&gt But adding stuff to Axon should require strong requirements</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:00] &lt Lawouach_&gt Considering that Axon is at the core of Kamaelia</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:01] &lt Lawouach_&gt It should be updated carefully</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:02] &lt mhrd&gt indeed. fwiw I think there may potentially be a strong case for some kind of timing/event capability ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:02] &lt mhrd&gt (in Axon) ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:02] &lt mhrd&gt Axon/Kamaelia systems naturally tend to 'free-run' and so in some cases need rate control - eg. reading data from a file</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:03] &lt Lawouach_&gt Yes I agree.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:04] &lt mhrd&gt Axon does deliberately concern itself already with the dynamics of teh system - it provides scheduling - ie. control over when stuff gets run ... even if the current scheduling algorithm is deliberately simple-stupid</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[09:05] &lt mhrd&gt yep</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:05] &lt mhrd&gt alot of the earlier file reading stuff, for example, relies on a separate timing component (or built in), which, in current implementations, busy-waits .... it functions well, but is less desireable wrt efficiency and playing nice with other processes :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:06] &lt Lawouach_&gt Incidently it'd be interesting if Axon mainloop could be run from within another host mainloop, e.g. use the Qt mainloop system to drive the Axon scheduling. This is more or less dosable already but it's neither clean nor straightforward in my book</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:07] &lt mhrd&gt agreed - it just about can be, but ought to be cleaner</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:09] &lt mhrd&gt I have tried doing rate control by enforcing size limits on all inboxes in a system (the video reframer app) ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:09] &lt mhrd&gt but writing components that behaved well in that situation turned out to be quite hard</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:09] &lt Lawouach_&gt I see</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:11] &lt mhrd&gt particularly wrt. ensuring shutdown through "control"-&gt"signal" messages can still happen even if components are 'stalled' because the inbox(es) they want to write to are full</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:13] &lt mhrd&gt ... sorry thats kind of an aside as it doesn't directly relate to Joe's idea, timing, scheduling :)</td></tr>
