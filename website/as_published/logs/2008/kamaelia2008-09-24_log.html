            <tr><td>[09:54] &lt mhrd&gt probably need both - the doc gen analysing code, for example, won't pick up anything within a conditional statement</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[09:59] &lt mhrd&gt at the time I drew the line there because it was an easy clear cut off - rather that having to give detailed explanation of what kind of expressions it would/would-not be able to evaluate :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:08] &lt vmlemon_&gt Out of interest, what's the problem with Zope?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:11] &lt MS-&gt It's the fact that Zope turned into a closed ecosystem - it was very hard to pull stuff out from it to use in non-zope systems.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:14] &lt vmlemon_&gt Aah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[10:15] &lt MS-&gt (this is a risk for kamaelia as well - hence why Axon is seperate and useful by itself, and also why Handle exists)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[10:16] &lt MS-&gt Also, the former means that when building components it's easier in many cases to pull in code from other libraries rather than reinvent wheels all the time. (As fun as wheel building is)</td></tr>
