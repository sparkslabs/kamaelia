            <tr><td>[15:36] &lt j_baker&gt Ok. The main thing that I was curious about is which exceptions are you talking about that don't get logged?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:39] &lt Davbo&gt Ah, sorry I'm not very familiar with Exceptions in Python, it just looked like your Exceptions were placeholders for something more....to actually handle them when they're raised</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:41] &lt j_baker&gt np... I'll look back over the code and see what's going on. (and python exceptions can be a tad difficult to pick up compared to other languages)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:41] &lt Davbo&gt Just seen this: raise WsgiError("write() called before start_response()!") - What happens to that parameter? it just seems odd to me</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:42] &lt j_baker&gt That parameter is just the message that's displayed in the traceback.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:42] &lt Davbo&gt Ohh.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:43] &lt j_baker&gt It will get logged though. Once the stack gets popped up to the main function, self._error will get called and that will log it.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:44] &lt Davbo&gt I apologise, but I've got to go. Back later.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[16:20] &lt j_baker&gt :) Yeah.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:20] &lt j_baker&gt Programming that would be so much simpler if you didn't have to take into account what a poorly written WSGI application can do.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:21] &lt Davbo&gt with lots of the support code it looks like you've wrote it once you encountered a limitation with the existing HTML stuff</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:22] &lt Davbo&gt which is why I didn't comment much once i read it, it only makes sense with the context of where that support code is called</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:23] &lt Davbo&gt (I was just comparing the old cookbook stuff with the new)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:24] &lt j_baker&gt Oh yeah. That cookbook example really confused me at first.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:25] &lt Lawouach&gt which one?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[16:25] &lt j_baker&gt The HTTPServer cookbook example.</td></tr>
