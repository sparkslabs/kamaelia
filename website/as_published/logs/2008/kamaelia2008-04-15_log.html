            <tr><td>[21:47] &lt vmlemon_&gt I think I only managed to get a few library packages installed, although most of the packages depended on later versions of various components</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[21:55] &lt vmlemon_&gt It's a shame to me that they're deciding to get rid of it, since it's one of the very few things that Mac OS X shares with it's predecessor (barring the name, of course)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[21:55] &lt j_baker&gt Personally, I'd prefer that Apple not be a slave to backwards compatibility like MS is, but I suppose I can see why some were frustrated with that decision.</td></tr>
