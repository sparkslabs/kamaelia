            <tr><td>[18:22] &lt MS-&gt If that's the case, the application should really be developed in a scratch branch for then later compartmentalising stuff out for merge onto trunk</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:25] &lt MS-&gt I wouldn't be a slave to convention. I'd say if you don't have a clear idea of what the names should be or where they live, do that.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:26] &lt MS-&gt Kamaelia.Apps should, for most apps, actually end up being a stub</td></tr>
