            <tr><td>[17:55] &lt MS-&gt It's very easy to annoy the twisted people. I accidentally did it once and have zero desire to do it again!</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:56] &lt vmlemon_&gt They certainly do sound Twisted ;)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:56] &lt MS-&gt Also, There are missing features in Kamaelia. I view that as one of those things rather than negative :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:56] &lt MS-&gt As for criticising twisted, I personally try to do the opposite for my own safety :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:19] &lt MS-&gt incidentally that thread of comments does raise a point</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:20] &lt MS-&gt You should not be calling GTK methods from a different thread from where GTK is running.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:20] &lt MS-&gt Largely because we *can't* at present run like the twisted gtk reactor. (glyph's correct in saying there's a missing feature)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:20] &lt MS-&gt I think most of the time though, you can sidestep that</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:21] &lt aa_&gt although that's the 4th article on my blog relating to the topic</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:21] &lt aa_&gt ooh, maybe I can nearly be an expert</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:21] &lt aa_&gt MS-: do you have anything like a job server?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:22] &lt aa_&gt MS-: I am imagining posting some python to it over the wire</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:22] &lt MS-&gt Might not be what you're after</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:23] &lt MS-&gt http://kamaelia.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Sketches/MPS/Experiments/DistPipe</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:23] &lt aa_&gt mm, I wonder if you could store the compiled code for a job and just run it ultra fast</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:23] &lt vmlemon_&gt Yay for dvbdate (it's one of those little utilities that only a few people know about, although it's handy if you can't connect to an NTP server, and have a DVB tuner)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:23] &lt aa_&gt MS-: thanks</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:24] &lt aa_&gt vmlemon_: that sounds very cool</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:25] &lt aa_&gt I can't miss hollyoaks</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:25] &lt vmlemon_&gt (AKA the MPEG-2-based services most people know as FreeView, Virgin Media and Sky Digital)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:26] &lt vmlemon_&gt (Or more correctly, the tech behind it)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:26] &lt aa_&gt oh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:26] &lt aa_&gt yeah freeview</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:26] &lt vmlemon_&gt From the room I'm in, I can't get E4, although I can lock onto the multiplex containing/broadcasting it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:26] &lt vmlemon_&gt :(</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:27] &lt aa_&gt ### XXX Probably a gaping security hole!!!</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:27] &lt aa_&gt haha, I think a job server is always going to have to have a huge security hole in it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:27] &lt vmlemon_&gt I can get BBC News (24), BBC One, and BBC Two right now</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:27] &lt MS-&gt aa_: It's a sketch :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:27] &lt MS-&gt Indeed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:28] &lt vmlemon_&gt and if i move my naff mini aerial, I can get Virgin1, The Hits/4Music and a few of EMAP's radio channels</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:28] &lt vmlemon_&gt Although the channel lists I have are slightly bigger, here</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:32] &lt vmlemon_&gt Looks like I can only get the multiplex with "Ideal World" on it, at the moment :(</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:32] &lt vmlemon_&gt dvbdate</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:32] &lt vmlemon_&gt Sun Oct 5 20:55:28 2008</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:32] &lt MS-&gt aa_: Added my tuppence worth</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:32] &lt MS-&gt dvbdate seems like a remarkably nice idea really</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:32] &lt vmlemon_&gt "sudo dvbdate --set" is the best feature</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:33] &lt vmlemon_&gt  --set (set the system clock to TDT time)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:33] &lt vmlemon_&gt (so the help output says)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:33] &lt MS-&gt aa_: I think the fundamental difference is that twisted being reactor based very much comes from the perspective of "don't call us, we'll call you".</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:33] &lt MS-&gt whereas Kamaelia very much is a lighttouch framework that tries to fit in with what you're doing - making your code slightly more sociable/chatty</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:34] &lt vmlemon_&gt And people complained about not being able to obtain the time, when they decided to phase out VBI Teletext for DVB services...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:34] &lt vmlemon_&gt (It's even easier to get that info, now ;) )</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:13] &lt MS-&gt OK, this is just *wrong* http://www.xs4all.nl/~weegen/eelis/analogliterals.xhtml</td></tr>
