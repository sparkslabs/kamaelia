            <tr><td>[17:17] &lt vmlemon_&gt I'm not too sure, but can't you use one of the HTTP components with LikeFile and pass that into PyGame?</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[17:48] &lt Chong-&gt MS-: thanks. just managed to do it by using urllib.urlopen and cStringIO.StringIO. I'll try kamaelia HTTP components later.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:50] &lt MS-&gt You realise that you have to now put that code inside a thread?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:50] &lt MS-&gt Since urllib is blocking?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:50] *** vmlemon_ just had an idea for a HTTP server component-based system that takes a HTTP URL like /record/outputfile.ts?freq=498.000000&pid=0x2000, tuned the DVB component as specified and records it in the named file, until the user goes to the URL /record/stop/outputfile.ts</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:50] &lt MS-&gt (hence the reason for the HTTP components existing)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:51] &lt MS-&gt vmlemon_: That's an interesting idea</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:53] &lt vmlemon_&gt (it could then make the browser download the finished TS file after the stop request is issued)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[17:53] &lt vmlemon_&gt In theory, you could also have it handle named channels, too</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:04] &lt MS-&gt yep</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:04] &lt Chong-&gt MS-: not sure what you mean "urllib is blocking". other parts of the code can still run after calling urllib.urlopen</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:05] *** MS- is in the middle of stuff right now</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:05] &lt MS-&gt urllib is blocking though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:05] &lt MS-&gt (just because one operation "returns" immediately doesn't mean it's not blocking)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:08] &lt Chong-&gt MS-: I see. sometimes bad network connection would cause it to block the whole program</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:12] &lt Chong-&gt and this is one advantage of kamaelia components :-)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:14] &lt MS-&gt Yep - can either fling urllib into a thread (easily) or use the http components</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:17] &lt vmlemon_&gt If only Kamaelia could handle/automate physical tasks like filling in paperwork, and other menial things ;)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:20] &lt Chong-&gt MS-: thanks, i'll try both. Can the outbox data of kamaelia HTTP components be handled by StringIO?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:20] &lt MS-&gt vmlemon_: I'd prefer that at the moment</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[18:21] &lt Chong-&gt vmlemon_: it needs a hardware kambot ;)</td></tr>
