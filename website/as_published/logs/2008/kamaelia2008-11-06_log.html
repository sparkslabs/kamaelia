            <tr><td>[20:20] &lt vmlemon_&gt (dvbsnoop is awful when you have more than 100MB of data in a file, and the only other option I've found is TSReader Lite (a crippled version of a Windows app) running under Wine) :(</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:20] &lt Rigolo&gt and .. as a softcam I use open-sasc-ng .. that creates a dvbloopback dvb adapter with decrypted streams :-)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[20:25] &lt vmlemon_&gt I know it'll handle the PIDs/raw data, but I don't know there's code for making sense of the said data</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:25] &lt vmlemon_&gt for doing stuff like converting the subtitles to text (they're graphics) or extracting files from MHEG-5 carousels</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:25] &lt vmlemon_&gt There was a tool for doing the latter, but it was fussy and needed to be used in conjunction with a tuned in app</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[20:25] &lt vmlemon_&gt Can you throw over a small (20MB compressed maximum) DVB-C TS to have a poke at?</td></tr>
