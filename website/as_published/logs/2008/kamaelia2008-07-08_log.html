            <tr><td>[08:54] &lt Trun&gt but when suggested by MS- and had some code done, I also liked the time based approach</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:55] &lt Trun&gt I find it more "realistic" and easier to interact with (it may seem closer to a debugger, like 'now I add this', and actually at that point that message is added)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:55] &lt Trun&gt but for instance, the test in the pastebin can't test if the Echoer uses a "while" or a "if" when gathering information from 'inbox'</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:57] &lt mhrd&gt actually thats a good example - its hard to test the behaviour at point of shutdown. eg. testing an assertion that the compnoent will finish off processing any pending data</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:58] &lt Trun&gt yep, so I like the idea of supporting both approaches</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:59] &lt mhrd&gt I suspect MS- may disagree with me over whether the precision of that kind of behaviour (at shutdown) really matters. I'm pretty sure I've built systems where I've needed it.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:59] &lt Trun&gt btw, are you comfortable with the approach of being integrated in a "unittest.TestCase"-like way?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:59] &lt mhrd&gt But I've tended to get more worried about shutdown behaviour than MS- in the past :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:59] &lt Trun&gt I mean, maybe something else should be built for that or this way may be fine?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:00] &lt mhrd&gt integrating like that looks pretty clean - nice to keep the familiar style of API, irrespective of whether the actual implementation subclasses it directly or not</td></tr>
