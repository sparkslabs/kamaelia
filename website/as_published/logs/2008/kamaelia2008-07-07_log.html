            <tr><td>[18:10] &lt Lawouach&gt My point is that from what I've seen, your application is well undergone and MIDI support wouldn't actually add much value from a GSoC perspective. Whereas being able to start working on important OSS aspects like tests, packaging, ensuring it works everywhere, etc. is more approriate IMO.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:13] &lt orphans&gt I think the biggest thing has been learning about setting up a project in a way, how good practice there serves you well further down the line</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[18:15] &lt orphans&gt probably the other major thing has been being a bit more systematic with design decisions - laying out the options and working through the strengths and weaknesses before diving in and trying them out</td></tr>
