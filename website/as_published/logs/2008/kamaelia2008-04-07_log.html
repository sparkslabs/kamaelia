            <tr><td>[09:01] &lt orphans&gt ahh, the joys of choice :) which of the ideas which look interesting do you think you know most about?</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[09:02] &lt orphans&gt i think the main thing the mentors want to see is that you have good ideas and are really enthusiastic about working for the summer on one thing</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:04] &lt orphans&gt otherwise it's kinda hard work knowing what progress you're making etc etc. At the end of the day if it's not something you can show you're really interested in by putting in a good focused proposal it's more of a risk for the project to have you as an SoC student</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:05] &lt Chong&gt To be honest, I am not an expert in all of them. But I have solid knowledge about computer programming and I am willing to learn these area-specific knowledge and practice my coding skills.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:06] &lt orphans&gt yeah, that's partly what it's all about :) It'd be useful if you could post up a few ideas for how you might go about doing one (or more) of the projects you are interested in</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[09:10] &lt orphans&gt fwiw I reckon you'd get on better and perhaps have a better chance if you picked the organization and project which you are most interested in and think you could bring a lot to, then go for that</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:11] &lt orphans&gt don't worry too much about which project needs people - if you put in a strong application which the developers like and can show you're enthusiastic then you are in with a shot</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[09:16] &lt orphans&gt I got my app in, and I'm kinda just waiting now - had a bit of feedback and stuff which is cool.
