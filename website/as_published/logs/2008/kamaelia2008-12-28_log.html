            <tr><td>[15:17] &lt vmlemon_&gt It'd be nice if ath5k actually supported monitor mode, and operating in "master" or "ad-hoc" mode at the same time, but alas, it doesn't :(</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:17] &lt vmlemon_&gt (Which makes the app useless)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:17] &lt vmlemon_&gt I'd be interested in seeing if someone can get it to work, though</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:17] &lt vmlemon_&gt Since it seems like a novel idea</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:18] &lt vmlemon_&gt It looks like the Wi-Fi card driver gets stuck at "ath5k phy0: unsupported jumbo" in dmesg, and stops receiving packets after a few hours, so I have to reboot to reset the registers in the card :|</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:19] &lt vmlemon_&gt And annoyingly, when it works, packets tend to have a bad CRC and drip in at an alarmingly slow rate</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:19] &lt vmlemon_&gt (About 2 per 3 hours or so)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:19] &lt vmlemon_&gt I can't even figure out where the problem lies</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:20] &lt vmlemon_&gt (i.e. in the Atheros card itself, in the ath5k driver, or because of windows on nearby buildings being closed so that Wi-Fi traffic can't penetrate through as easily)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:21] &lt vmlemon_&gt I had another card with almost the same chipset in another laptop, and never had those problems :(</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:21] &lt vmlemon_&gt (This one has a different MAC and PHY version)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:23] &lt vmlemon_&gt Still, I'm fairly disappointed, since I buy cards (or machines containing them) out of principle, since they've supported Linux well as of late</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:23] &lt vmlemon_&gt (Unlike Broadcom and some other companies</td></tr>
