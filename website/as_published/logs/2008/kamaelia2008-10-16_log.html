            <tr><td>[14:55] &lt MS-&gt Chong-: Thanks for reminding me about the uni library. I now have 4 prolog books out and a 5th one waiting for me in stores :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:55] &lt MS-&gt And, as a result, one of them *IS* the prolog book I remembered that is both readable, clear and shows useful usecases.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:56] &lt MS-&gt Also came across one that was unexpectedly useful because it doesn't mention prolog on the cover, in the title, and only once in passing in the blurb on the back cover</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[14:57] &lt MS-&gt It's useful because it defines a virtual machine for executing / evaluating prolog (which is really what I'm interested in) rather than on just the usual very basic/repeated examples of prolog use</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[15:12] &lt eikenberry&gt I'll ask him when he gets back. What was the one that was good?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[15:13] &lt Chong-&gt The one that was good should be Conlon, Tom. Learning Micro-PROLOG: A Problem-Solving Approach. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1985.</td></tr>
