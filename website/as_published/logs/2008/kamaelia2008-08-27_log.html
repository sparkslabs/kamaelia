            <tr><td>[13:12] &lt j_baker&gt Yeah. He's a smart guy. It's just that he's your average grad student with next to no real world experience. I got a similar reaction when I asked him what version control software he was familiar with. :(</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[13:31] &lt j_baker&gt And yeah, I agree. I really think that universities nowadays have their priorities out of line. I wish they would teach more about things like version control and unit testing before they get into the deeper CS subjects.</td></tr>
