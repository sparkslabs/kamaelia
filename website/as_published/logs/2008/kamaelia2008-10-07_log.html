            <tr><td>[12:37] &lt aa_&gt oh hmm..</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:37] &lt MS-&gt As a result if we needed to relicense, we could just do that - there's a few possible scenarios that make sense there.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:37] &lt aa_&gt right, relicensing is our sisue</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:38] &lt MS-&gt But the core thing there is that it means that all contributors own their code.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:38] &lt aa_&gt right</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:38] &lt MS-&gt So that's why it says Copyright Kamaelia Contributors</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:38] &lt MS-&gt Yep - that's possible, but not likely</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:39] &lt MS-&gt Also the BBC is a wierd case. If it was proprietary, then the only case I can think of is licensing to a third party (eg a set top box manufacturer)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:39] &lt MS-&gt which would be (at most) a nominal sum.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:40] &lt aa_&gt right</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:40] &lt MS-&gt But, seeing as it's the BBC, what that would actually mean is it would end up going to fund more TV stuff</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:40] &lt aa_&gt yes</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:40] &lt MS-&gt Which isn't actually a bad thing - and benefits everyone - unlike private company which would just profit</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:41] &lt MS-&gt When it's done it, it's done well. Most of the time it's been pain.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:42] &lt MS-&gt eg good examples: Nicam & the LSI/BBC R&D DVB chip</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:42] &lt MS-&gt also some 3D systems that lots of general public won't've heard of</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:43] &lt MS-&gt NICAM however is an oddity because it was 5-10 years old *at least* before it became useful</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:43] &lt MS-&gt since it was invented as a mechanism for 12 bit sampling (IIRC) digital radio</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:43] &lt MS-&gt (could be wrong on the number of bits :) )</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:44] &lt MS-&gt Wasn't good enough, so scrapped until someone realised that it was good enough for TV and could get sent out</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:44] &lt MS-&gt ie the tech failed and languished for many years before finding an application</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:45] &lt MS-&gt indirectly it drove the mass acceptance of timeshifting though, since most people got NICAM stereo by buying a VCR, rather than a new TV</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt aa_&gt hmm, yeah I remember a time when you could get a non-nicam steroe vcr</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt aa_&gt I in fact was tricked into buying one</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:47] &lt aa_&gt anyway here's to kamaelia being bigger than Nicam :D</td></tr>
