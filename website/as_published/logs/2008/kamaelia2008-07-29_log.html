            <tr><td>[09:33] &lt orphans&gt aside from me being an idiot it's surprisingly nice to work with - for simple stuff it's really easy to get it up and running</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[09:34] &lt mhrd-afk&gt looks to be quicker than pyrex :-) what I liked about pyrex was that it let me easily write glue code to convert a C API into something more pythonic</td></tr>
