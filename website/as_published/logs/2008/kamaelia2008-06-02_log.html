            <tr><td>[08:29] &lt Lawouach_&gt Well if your timer is not precise enoufgh, or in other way if you can't rely on it, you have to provide the audio synchronisation at a different stage</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:32] &lt orphans&gt yeah, it's more about knowing when to trigger to get them out fast enough</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:33] &lt Lawouach_&gt Hmm. Still you don't necessarily have control on how the consumer will deal with your way of sending messages out.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:33] &lt Lawouach_&gt Meaning you have to be rather sensible in your producer</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:33] &lt orphans&gt the spec says that the consumer should just deal with the messages as they arrive</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:33] &lt mhrd&gt yeah, the problem is you're not running on a "real time OS" with a real time "hard" scheduler ...</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:34] &lt mhrd&gt any requests your thread makes to be woken at any time are just a request - the OS will not guarantee to honour it ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:34] &lt mhrd&gt so saying sleep(10ms) will only guarantee that you will be woken *at least* 10ms later ...</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:34] &lt mhrd&gt so if you're trying to time output and you don't want to get behind, then you want to find out what the new time is after the sleep() returns; and compensate ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:34] &lt mhrd&gt cool</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:34] &lt Lawouach_&gt maybe you could think it the other way</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:34] &lt orphans&gt MS-'s code illustrates it nicely</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:35] &lt Lawouach_&gt Rather than doing time-based sync', you could use size-based sync'</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:35] &lt Lawouach_&gt like a socket buffer</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:36] &lt Lawouach_&gt But would that play well with existing consumers and the way most people would implement consumers... I don't know :)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[08:36] &lt Lawouach_&gt :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:36] &lt orphans&gt mm. The other think I haven't really looked at properly is OSC supposedly supports timestamping</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:37] &lt orphans&gt not sure how much it's actually supported, but that might make the whole job a bit easier</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:37] &lt mhrd&gt its a timer I wrote to improve rate-controlled file reading; and it does alot of stuff to compensate for timer delays and to try to prevent drift due to rounding errors</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:37] &lt mhrd&gt if you can attach playout timestamps to the data you're writing out then that sounds an excellent plan :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:37] *** bNickName has joined #kamaelia</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:38] &lt orphans&gt the problem is that you really want to be signalling as close to the time you want it played, cause someone might delete/change it in the meantime</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:39] &lt mhrd&gt its a trade off that is a weakness of doing stuff with computers, particularly with desktop multitasking OSes ..</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:39] &lt Lawouach_&gt orphans: well it depends really. Do you plan that every peer in the network lays the sound right at the same time?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:39] &lt mhrd&gt you've got a trade-off to determine: how small can you make your buffer before spikes in CPU load (from other activity) causes problems</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:40] &lt Lawouach_&gt It seems to me that you want the music to be continuous locally where it's played. But it might be offset from other peers</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:40] &lt orphans&gt Lawouach_, it's not massively important, probably more important locally</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:40] &lt Lawouach_&gt Okay</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:40] &lt orphans&gt well, definitely more important locally</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:40] &lt Lawouach_&gt so that already allievates part of the concurrency and synchronisation constraints.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:40] &lt mhrd&gt simplest way to determine it is 1) experimentally, 2) provide a user controllable buffer size (since their system will be different to yours)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:41] &lt orphans&gt I'm not 100% sure I understand the idea of the data buffer completely</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:41] &lt mhrd&gt ok: take the situation that you're playing a WAV file ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:41] &lt orphans&gt yup</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:42] &lt mhrd&gt the OS, application software, etc. will be rubbish at doing exact timing ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:42] &lt orphans&gt don't I know it</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:42] &lt mhrd&gt so its completely impractical, to say, try to generate an interrupt every time a single sample needs to be played out, and to try and play it out exactly on time ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:43] &lt orphans&gt uh huh</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:43] &lt mhrd&gt so the way your PC solves it is the sound hardware has a big input buffer</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:43] &lt mhrd&gt and only interrupts the system when the buffer is starting to run dry</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:43] &lt orphans&gt yeah</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:43] &lt mhrd&gt then then software fills it with a large chunk of data</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt mhrd&gt so the exact time this is done at doesn't matter so much - and the cpu is being interrupted less often, which is more efficient</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt Lawouach_&gt and user experience is good :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt mhrd&gt the sound hardware then has hardware timers and plays the individual samples out of the buffer when they're needed (every 441000's of a second for example)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt mhrd&gt yep</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt mhrd&gt the trade-off of course, is that the latency is higher (because you've got a big buffer in the way)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:44] &lt orphans&gt ok, so how does that correlate to the sporadic case? I timestamp all of the messages and send the buffer every n ms?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:45] &lt mhrd&gt if the playout system will accept timestamped data, then you just try to make sure the buffer is always reasonably full (as Lawouach_ suggests)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:45] *** Chong- has parted #kamaelia</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:45] &lt mhrd&gt if it doesn't; another solution might be to try to find a way to go from sporadic to periodic ...</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:46] &lt Lawouach_&gt orphans: just one general note, trying to make things highly synchronised is usually hard and rarely needed in most domains. The buffer solution is usually a way to compensate for the trade off made by the OS.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:46] &lt mhrd&gt indeed</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:46] &lt mhrd&gt eg. is it possible to fill in the gaps with some kind of null message? and instruct the receiving programme to play out one message every 'x' milliseconds</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:47] &lt Lawouach_&gt Areas where you would need perfect real-time synchronisation would be stoke market, health care, planes. Try to ask yourself: "does my application require such high standard as a plane software?" :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:47] &lt mhrd&gt people pay big premiums for dedicated specialist equipment to do low latency/highly synchronised versions of the same jobs a cheap PC can do with poor timing/latency</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:47] &lt orphans&gt mhrd: mm, probably possible if you do a lot of work on the receiving program, but not in the general case</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[08:47] &lt mhrd&gt Lawouach_ : many broadcasting apps too :)</td></tr>
