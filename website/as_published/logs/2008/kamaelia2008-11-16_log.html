            <tr><td>[18:38] &lt heckj_&gt Question for the Kamaelia general crew: I'm making a little simulation with Kamaelia. In the sim, I've set it up with a "world" component that periodically sends updates to all the actors in the simulation, and expects to receive messages from them. Should I be trying to use something like a Backplane for communicating out, or is just directly linking the mailboxes just as easy?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:12] *** MS- reads back</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:12] &lt MS-&gt Personally I'd use the backplane, since it's the easiest way of managing things :)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:13] &lt MS-&gt I'd be tempted to use a backplane for both directions in fact since then it's easier to attach more components to both backplanes as producers/consumers to see what's going on for logging activity</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:14] &lt MS-&gt I must admit I probably over use backplanes these days for that sort of thing, but they do make like alot simpler</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:14] &lt MS-&gt For much the same reason people like most pub/sub architectures</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:19] &lt heckj_&gt I am resurrecting some older code where I was just pushing straight into the inbox (hacking the Axon component for no reason that I can recall) - so now I'm rejiggering the code to do it differently. The backplane seemed like a good solution much along those lines.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[19:21] &lt MS-&gt Probably. If you're posting messages to lots of things that's a canonical case where the backplane makes sens</td></tr>
