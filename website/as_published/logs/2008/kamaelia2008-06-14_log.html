            <tr><td>[12:10] &lt MS-&gt Technically they probably can't do anything with it because libavcodec actually implements lots of patented codecs</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:13] &lt MS-&gt For example consumer cameras with MP4 encoding support only *technically* have a license for use in a domestic setting (at least some cameras)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:13] &lt MS-&gt which means using them to make a video short, seems reasonable</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:15] &lt Lawouach&gt In such case using a binding like pymedia would be fine as long as you don't distribute libavcodec along</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[12:17] &lt MS-&gt It's also why I think libavcodec is hosted in hungary these days - because of laws in that country</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[12:17] &lt MS-&gt basically meaning they can distribute it, shifting the onus onto the person who recieves it for it to be legal for them to have a copy</td></tr>
