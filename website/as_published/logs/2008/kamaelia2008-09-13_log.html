            <tr><td>[11:06] &lt MS-&gt OK - I've realised that I need to rewrite my presentation, so that's what I'm doing, but the upside is I know precisely what sort of approach I'm taking :)</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:09] &lt MS-&gt Turned out they were using locking and threads and had found a bug's core problem (and solved it) more by luck than by design</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:09] &lt MS-&gt Which reminded me of the real problems other people tend to have with concurrency (stuff I've not had to worry about now for some time :) )</td></tr>

            <tr><td>[11:17] &lt MS-&gt Basically, one of the hidden assumptions in my talks has been "so what *is* the problem with concurrency, and why is our approach more sensible (for many classes of problems) than using threads, locks, mutexes & semaphores (for example)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:18] &lt MS-&gt So I've put that in rather explicitly, and I'm using a pygame example - moving sprites round the screen - as a concrete counter example</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:18] &lt MS-&gt (after having mentioned a whole slew of real systems built over the past year)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:19] &lt MS-&gt The idea being in this case to pull out the more explicit 1:1 nature of problem, representation & code</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:19] &lt MS-&gt (at least in the beginner/intro talk)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>[11:19] &lt MS-&gt Has to talk to both novices "you do it like this" and experienced devs "this is why we do it"</td></tr>
