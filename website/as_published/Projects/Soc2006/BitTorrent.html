</li></ol>
<br>
<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>I plan to integrate the Mainline (official) BitTorrent client with
Kamaelia, encapsulating it as a threaded component to prevent it
blocking an entire pipeline and removing the requirement for the client
to yield periodically. This should require few if any changes to the
core BitTorrent code, allowing updates to BitTorrent to be easily
supported by my component. In order to interface with Kamaelia my
current plan is to modify the console bittorrent-console.py user
interface so that rather than outputting to the console it uses
outboxes. Rather than transferring downloaded files via outboxes, they
will be stored as a file on disk that can be read by a separate
component.</p>


<p>I intend to allow pseudo-real-time delivery of streaming data by
splitting it into chunks of a predetermined number of bytes, and
uploading these chunks to the BitTorrent network as they are completed.
Such should allow live video to be distributed to broadband users with
a delay in terms of minutes, without requiring the video feed to come
to an end.</p>
<hr width='100%'><br>
<h3>Project Title: BitTorrent client/seeder component</h3>
<br>
Benefits
to Kamaelia: This component could be one of the building blocks of a
new platform independent BBC Internet Media Player, which would let
non-Windows users access this service. In addition to this specific
use, in media content delivery having an efficient distribution system
is a key element. For example, coupled with DRM it could be used to
distribute the stock footage the BBC sells. BitTorrent helps develop a
very scalable method for delivering content to users. Not only this
would save bandwidth costs, but for example if a server-side
application using kamaelia goes for using this component to act as a
BitTorrent server, this protocol being a standard end-users would be
free to use their favorite BitTorrent client application to interact
with the server application. For developer using kamaelia, this would
be a very simple way to let applications make simple use of BitTorrent
to download and upload data.<br>
<br>
Synopsis:<br>
This project aims at
developing kamaelia components letting applications rely on the
BitTorrent protocol for content delivery and download. The component
will be broken down into sub-elements that could be used with different
peer to peer protocols than BitTorrent. The objective is to let
programmers very easily integrate BitTorrent support into their
applications.<br>
<br>
Deliverables:<br>
<br>
* Will deliver:<br>
<br>
The
first component would handle file management, to let the application
write downloaded files in the most efficient way. As BitTorrent
downloads chunks of data in random order, this introduces various
issues regarding the efficiency of file access, with possible solutions
such as creating an empty file at the beginning of the download that
will be modified every time a new chunk of data is collected. This
component aims at providing solutions to those issues and provide a
file access manager that could be used for any protocol such as
BitTorrent that could result in random file writes. It is important to
note that the design of the component will be so that it is not only
for BitTorrent and can be used in a more general way.<br>
<br>
A
connection manager. BitTorrent tends to be using many connections at
once, and this component would help managing how many connections at a
time are open and methods to open/close them. BitTorrent's efficiency
is very dependent on how many connections at a time are open. Some
routers react badly to the big amount<br>
of simultaneous connections
BitTorrent uses, and usually BiTorrent clients lack the ability to
adapt to this issue. This component would aim at dynamically adapting
the pool of connections BitTorrent uses to help it be more efficient.
Again this component will be designed so that it can be used with other
protocols relying on many simultaneous connections.<br>
<br>
BitTorrent
tools. This component will provide low level BitTorrent tools, such as
bencoding/bdecoding, metainfo management, used by both BitTorrent peer
and tracker applications.<br>
<br>
BitTorrent peer component. This is the
main objective of the project, which relies on the three previews low
level components. It will let applications download and upload data
using the BitTorrent protocol.<br>
<br>
* Given sufficient time:<br>
<br>
A
BitTorrent tracking component. Managing peers efficiently and
calculating data regarding the various torrents tracked. This component
will manage statistics and provide easy access to it, leaving the
developer free to use other components for the data display. The peer
management part of the component could lead to separating them into
lower level components.<br>
<br>
It is likely the above will be adapted
during the research and design phase of the project. For example it may
come out of the design that mechanisms currently in the BitTorrent peer
component could be extracted into more generalist low level components.<br>
<br>
Project Details:<br>
<br>
The
project is likely to start by studying the official BitTorrent client
source code and make sense of the way it implements the protocol. There
are many elements were a better solution could be searched for,
especially for the choking/unchoking algorithm. Comparing he
performance should be easy once the basics have been developed, it will
be a matter of comparing how fast the same torrent is downloaded using
the official client and the one developed during this project.<br>
<br>
I
will design on paper the various components included in this project,
so that they integrate well into the kamaelia architecture. It is
important to see how the support of bittorrent can be included while
still keeping the philosophy underlying in kamaelia.<br>
<br>
The test
phase will be crucial. There are so many elements in the BitTorrent
protocol that could go wrong if some clients don't behave as described
in the standard. This phase will probably require developing 'bad
clients' that would behave in a non-standard way in order to stress
test the BitTorrent client developed for kamaelia. Same goes for the
file manager, test applications will be necessary in order to see how
it behaves in extreme conditions.<br>
<br>
Project Schedule:<br>
<br>
23rd May -&gt; 1st June:<br>
Study
of the problem and how it can be solved. Design of the components
architecture on paper. Playing around with kamaelia and its source code
to get a better idea of its philosophy and how it works.<br>
<br>
1st June -&gt; 7th June:<br>
Development of the file management component. Tests sets and preliminary design of the stress testing application.<br>
<br>
7th June -&gt; 14th June:<br>
Testing
and debugging of the file management component. By the end of the
period the component should be considered validated and fully working.<br>
<br>
15th June -&gt; 23th June:<br>
Development
of the connections manager component. Tests sets and preliminary design
of the stress testing application. It would be interesting to see how
it can be tested with simpler protocols than BitTorrent (such as
FTP/HTTP downloads).<br>
<br>
24th June -&gt; 30th June:<br>
Testing and
debugging of the connections manager component. By the end of the
period the component should be considered validated and fully working.<br>
<br>
1st July -&gt; 10th July:<br>
Complete
development, testing and debugging of the BitTorrent tools component.
This aspect should be more straightforward than the rest of the
project, and should give time to test more the previously developed
component, as well as correcting the design of the peer component.<br>
<br>
11th July -&gt; 25th July:<br>
Development
of the peer component. Tests sets and preliminary design of the stress
testing application. Tests for the previously developed components
should be updated to take into consideration how this one makes use of
the previous ones.<br>
<br>
26th July -&gt; 2nd August:<br>
Final testing and debugging of all the components developed during the project.<br>
<br>
3rd August -&gt; 21st August:<br>
Buffer
period, which will either be used to develop the tracker component or
for additional time on the previous tasks if they run late.<br>

<h3>Project title: Creation of an integrated bittorrent component</h3>
<br>
:Benefits:<br>
<br>
Kamaelia and the BBC would benefit from the ability to distribute large media files quickly and cheaply.<br>
<br>
:Building a bittorrent component for the Kamaelia toolkit:<br>
<br>
The
bittorrent protocol is a very effective way of distributing large files
between many clients. Once a client has acquired a piece of a file, it
can start to upload that piece to other clients. This uploading between
clients has two major advantages: First, the more clients downloading
means more clients uploading so download speeds are higher. Second, the
cost of bandwidth is spread between the clients and not a few central
servers.<br>
<br>
These advantages of the bittorrent protocol make it
very suitable to distribute media such as audio and video, the file
sizes are large and often there will be many clients wanting the data
at any time.<br>
<br>
My proposal is to create a bittorrent component for
the Kamaelia project as described in http://tinyurl.com/oephq. This
would be useful for creating applications that need to acquire a lot of
data (such as a video player) but do not need the data right away.<br>
<br>
:Example usage case:<br>
<br>
Mike
(a hypothetical user) loads up his media player build around Kamaelia.
He has just developed an interest in gardening and so using the media
players built in search he finds a list of series about gardening.
Seeing one he likes the look of, he clicks on a subscribe button. This
subscription is done using RSS or something similar. When a new episode
of his subscribed program becomes available, the following happens:<br>
<br>
1. Mike's media player discovers the new episode through the subscribed RSS feed.<br>
2.
The media player then starts the bittorrent client component in the
background and sends the .torrent file provided in the RSS feed to it.<br>
3.
The bittorrent component starts to download. Because there are many
other people subscribed to the same gardening show there are many
people uploading so the download is nice a quick, perhaps just a few
hours.<br>
4. Once the download is complete, the bittorrent client
component send sends a message to the media player saying the data is
ready.<br>
5. The media player then informs mike that a new episode is ready to watch, perhaps by placing an entry in a visible playlist.<br>
6. Mike see's the new episode and clicks play.<br>
<br>
Most
of this process is hidden from Mike. He does not need to know about RSS
feeds or that an episode of a subscribed program is available until it
has been downloaded and is ready to watch.<br>
<br>
:Deliverables:<br>
<br>
- Bittorrent client component, full bittorrent protocol support, headless operation.<br>
- Control component for clients to download and view media.<br>
- Control component for distributing media, control uploading (seeding).<br>

<br>
I
expect the best way to do this will be to create a bittorrent client
component first, which can run in the background and be controlled by
other components though a documented messaging interface. Control
components will have the ability to start/stop a torrent, control
download and upload rates, query progress and serve data to another
Kamaelia component once downloading is complete.<br>
<br>
Many other
components could then be written which can control the bittorrent
client. Control components could be media players using pygame as an
interface, or components for controlling the seeding (initial
uploading) of a new file.<br>
<br>
:Project schedule:<br>
<br>
- Become familiar with Kamaelia framework. This should not take too long, a week or so.<br>
<br>
-
Research and discuss with other Kamaelia developers the best way to
build the bittorrent client component. This includes deciding on the
messaging protocol between this and other components that will use it.<br>
<br>
-
Build bittorrent client component. This is the most important
deliverable and has priority. Once complete the rest of the summer can
be spent working on components that use this client component.<br>
<br>
- Build component to control seeding/uploading of a new torrent. Used to distribute new media.<br>
- Build a component for clients to request and once downloaded, view the contents of a torrent.<br><br>
