<h1>SoC Projects : Peer To Peer Streaming</h1><p>There was one  project application in this area that is summarised

</p><h3>Peer-to-Peer streaming architecture using Kamaelia<br></h3><p>*Project motivation*<br>In recent years the concept of peer-to-peer streaming has received increased attention from the academic and<br>research communities, partly because the Internet doesn't widely support multicast, and because of the need for<br>a large scale content distribution system.<br><br>The project I would like to work on is an experiment with such an architecture. The core idea is that each peer<br>that takes part in such an architecture can receive data segments from several other peers, aggregate and play them,<br>and also server data segments (at various rates), to other peers. The Kamaelia-based approach is to have a component<br>that receives media streaming segments from a number of similar components, and can also serve a number of other components with the media it receives. It should be able to take advantage of local multicast facilities.<br><br>From the perspective of the challenges that BBC Research is facing, this project would be an attempt to integrate<br>P2P and Multicast, because it provide a way to deliver media streaming information between smaller multicast islands,<br>where effective communication will be achieved by more efficient, lower-level, mechanisms.<br><br>Here is a selected list of papers regarding these topics:<br><br>http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/xu02peertopeer.html<br>http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/575162.html<br>http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/fl/flevents/wace/wace2005/papers/eetemadhi.pdf<br><br>*Architecture*<br><br>The core component to the architecture is a component that can receive data segments from N other components, aggregate them, and send them to a "player" component. Also, based on the underlying allocation algorithm, it can serve data segments to other peers itself. For the beginning the streaming data will be a simple integer stream, and the "player" a checker for consistency (mainly, whether the segments are in the right order, and whether there are missing segments).<br><br>A subset of peers will have only one input, from a component named a "seeder", which will generate the data. The discovery and the process of building the architecture still present some challenges, and I will probably start with a statically specified architecture; using a "building" utility, that reads this topology's description from a file and builds its logical structure in Python by interconnecting the "peer" components. Also, I will try to explore different algorithms and strategies for initial building of the topology, and its maintenance.<br><br>A special case is that of the multicast islands. Because they support more efficient ways of communication, it is reasonable that they are treated as a single peer by the external network. This possibility suggests the following architecture choice: each peer can be linked to its own Multicast_transceiver, that communicates to the multicast island this peer takes part in. This separation allows us to receive data "into" the multicast island through more than one peers, a more realistic approach to a high demand network.<br><br>To sum up we have:<br>* seeders, that generate the data<br>* peers, that have a sense of the topology surrounding them; they receive streaming data from several other peers and feed it into the player; moreover, it can be connected to a Multicast_transceiver in case it takes part in a multicast island, and can relay streaming data to a number of other peers<br>* player, which will aggregate the data segments in the correct order, perform buffering, if required, and "play" the data, depending on its type<br><br>Problems that need to be addressed:<br>* initial topology setup<br>* topology maintenance<br>* multicast islands identification<br>* from a peer's point of view, the network discovery<br><br>Finally, I would like to try some experiments using "real" audio or video streaming, as opposed to simplified mock-up data.<br><br>*Timeline*<br><br>* 20 June - detailed specifications for the architecture and the peer component<br>* 30 June - implementation of the peer, seeder and player components, for a simplified data stream<br>* 20 July - multicast and support for audio or video data<br>* 1 August - automatic topology discovering, using one or more directories<br>* 20 August - documentation, testing, experimenting<br><br>*Deliverables*<br><br>* the implementation of the "peer", "seeder" and "player" components, with documentation<br>* the utilities used to set up a topology<br>* a detailed report describing the approach and algorithms used<br>* a tutorial for using the components<br><br></p>
