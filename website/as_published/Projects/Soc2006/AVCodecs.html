<h1>SoC Project: Increased Audio/Video Codec Support<br></h1>There were 3 project applications in this area that are summarised here. This page contains the depersonalised content, which can be consolidated as necessary. The depersonalisation is for privacy reasons, credit is here due to those who spent the time writing these descriptions.<br><h3>Project Title: Creation of Ogg Vorbis Encoder and mp3 Encoder/Decoder component bindings for Kamaelia.</h3>Benefits to Kamaelia:<br><br>There are existing components for decoding Ogg Vorbis and Dirac multimedia formats in Kamaelia. But there are no existing Ogg Vorbis Encoding components and no mp3 Encoding/Decoding components. Ogg Vorbis &amp; mp3 support will provide the Kamaelia toolkit a lot of versatility. Kamaelia is already an excellent Free Software project and these two AV component bindings will make it extremely useful in a wide range of situations.<br><br>Synopsis:<br><br>mp3 is the current de-facto standard any type of audio transmission. Ogg Vorbis is also a Free and Open Source audio format which is slowly becoming very popular. Kamaelia though being an excellent toolkit unfortunately lacks the above two. I will write component bindings for mp3 encoding/decoding and also the encoding part of Ogg Vorbis as the decoding part is already present in Kamaelia.<br><br>This will enable Kamaelia to create and handle mp3, Ogg Vorbis streams. The components will be created in Python by wrapping already existing C library functions provided by libvorbis and ffmpeg (libavcodec). I will also take a look at wrapping the video codecs in libavcodec and components for putting in and extracting video from a container format if time permits so.<br><br>Deliverables:<br><br>The Project deliverables are --<br><ul><li>The Ogg Vorbis encoder component</li><li>The mp3 encoder &amp; decoder components</li><li>Test cases for the above</li><li>Documentation and recipies for the CookBook<br></li></ul>And given sufficient time --<br><ul><li>Components for handling a video codec</li><li>Components for putting encoding audio and video into a container format (eg AVI), and components for extracting audio and video from that container format.</li></ul>      <br>Project Details:<br><br>The project will mainly wrap available AV codecs with Python and create lightweight components which will be used from within Kamaelia. The best tool for this job is <a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/%7Egreg/python/Pyrex/">Pyrex</a>. Pyrex is a programming language which is used for creating C modules for Python. With Pyrex, there is no need to write glue-code. I can import &amp; directly use the C library as if they were Python data-types &amp; functions. Pyrex code can be then compiled to create a Python module which can then be imported and used from within Python programs.<br><br>I will thus use Pyrex and wrap the functions and datatypes provided by libvorbis and libavcodec. Then that Pyrex code will be compiled to generate lightweight Python modules which can be used directly from within Kamaelia.<br><br>The project will be useful in showcasing how to write Python bindings for different libraries like libavcodec. In fact, the Python modules can be used for any Python project, for example say, a multimedia application written in Python. Thus its usage won't be restricted to only this project and will be useful for all.<br><br>I already have a fair amount of Python programming experience having written quite a few apps for my college projects. I don't have much idea about Pyrex as such, but I have some experience with extending Python by writing modules in C and also some SWIG. I will read the <a href="http://ldots.org/pyrex-guide/">Pyrex documentation</a> and I don't think it will take much time for me to understand Pyrex. I also need to take a look at <a href="http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/%7Eboehme/using_libavcodec.html">libavcodec's API docs</a> to understand its innards better.<br><br>Project Schedule:<br><br>I will start with wrapping libavcodec first and then will look at libvorbis. Together, they would take around 2 weeks to be completed with documentation. Writing test cases and recipies will take one more week to be completed. So in total it will take around 3 weeks to be finished. Ironically, despite the estimates, software projects usually take Pi times more than the estimated time --- Murphy is particularly interested in software projects it seems ;) So I will presume that it will take at least 9-10 months for me to fully develop and test the project. If by any chance I finish early, I will start working on video codecs in libavcodec and also take a look at handling container formats for video.<br><br>The development will be done completely in the open and the code will be hosted on sourceforge.net or somewhere else if available. I intend to do one Alpha and two Beta releases before doing the stable release to ensure better testing of the code.<br><br>An estimated project timeline is as below --<br><br>May 23, 2006 -- Start of project<br>June 19, 2006 -- First Alpha Release<br>Interim period -- Continuous testing and feedback from the community<br>July 19, 2006 -- First Beta Release<br>Interim period -- Continuous testing and feedback from the community<br>August 01, 2006 -- Second Beta Release, Documentation released<br>Interim period -- Continuous testing and feedback from the community<br>August 19, 2006 -- Stable release of code<br>August 21, 2006 -- Code submission to Google<br><br><hr width='100%'><br>
<br><h3>Additional AV codecs in Kamaelia</h3>Additional AV codecs in Kamaelia<br><br>This is a proposal to create Kamaelia components to manipulate audio and video data. This would include support for the MP3 codec, MPEG-2 video, and Speex.<br><br>This will allow more flexibility for Kamaelia as a multimedia platform. This will help Kamaelia's goal as an agent of the BBC to efficiently deal with its massive distribution requirements.<br><br>I would deliver components for encoding and decoding MP3, MPEG-2 video, and Speex data. The components would be thoroughly tested and documented with pydoc so that they will integrate easily into the component reference.<br><br>I plan to implement support for these data formats by wrapping existing C libraries with Pyrex to create bindings into Python and then creating components from that. I plan to use libmad <http:> to deal with MP3, which would also support audio layers I and II, and MPEG-2 audio. I would use libmpeg2 <http:> to handle MPEG-2 video,and this would incidentally also wrap support for MPEG-1.<br><br>One of the most interesting codecs that I would provide components to deal with is Speex <http:>. Speex is a patent-unencumbered codec designed for voice communications. With Kamaelia's goal of strong multimedia support and the ease of creating server components for it, a codec designed especially for voice is a good idea. It would be simple to make a voice communication system built on top of Speex that would work more efficiently than one that made use of Vorbis.<br><br>If I had time, I would create components to support the FLAC lossless audio codec. It would be nice to have support for an audio codec that is not lossy but does employ some sort of compression.<br><br>By the halfway point I expect to have fully componentized MP3 using libmad, along with documentation and testing. After that, I think the process will pick up speed. By the end of the Summer of Code, I plan to have wrapped libmad, libmpeg2, and libspeex; I would of course provide components and documentation for these. If I had time at the end, I would work on wrapping and creating components for libflac <http:>.<br><hr width='100%'><br></http:></http:></http:></http:><h3>A set of components for flexible media playback.<br></h3>Benefits to Kamaelia: Since Kamaelia is a toy box, there has to be good toys. Seeing how most media available today is either mp3, mpeg or avi Kamaelia should also support playing with these formats (Are you discriminating!?!). This will make Kamaelia more flexible, and more people will find it interesting to use.<br><br>Synopsis: 2 paras (maybe 3)<br>A set of components that allow users to use mp3, mpeg and avi files in their programs. The components will be based around the same class, and should therefore be very easy change (even at runtime!!).<br><br>Deliverables:<br>A set of components made in Python with Pymedia that decode and encode video and audio. There will be components for at least mp3, mpeg and basic avi formats. The components should inherit from a basic encode and decoder class, and be easy to interchange as one sees fit. The components will be based on unit tests, and will have documentation according to the standard for Kamaelia components (docstrings it seems like). Also an example application that utilizes the components will be delivered.<br><br>If this goes as smooth as I want to I will expand the component set to include the most used formats (xvid, divx's, vob?), also a real-time filter component could be nice, but I am not sure it is doable.<br><br>A neat extra would be to implement a component that handles the format that is used for mobile streaming (or is it just mpeg/avi?). This way it would be easy to make programs that streams stuff to the mobile phone. Maybe a stream of the whiteboard component, so that people can follow the whiteboard while on the buss.<br><br>Project Details:<br>The project will base itself on Python and Pymedia. I believe this will suffice to make components for most formats that should be desired, but I may be wrong since I don't know much about Kamaelia yet. The Pymedia module offers a nice and easy way to get raw output from most formats (I've only tried with mpeg), and the different components should therefore be quite simple to make.<br><br>I would have to start by getting to know Kamaelia, then figure out a good way to implement the components to fit Kamaelia. Once this is done, unit tests should be developed. A decent class/component that the different formats could inherit should come next, with the format specific components following. Docstring documentation will be written at the same time.<br><br>The real-time filter could be done with a Numpy/Numeric array and the raw frame data, but I am not sure (got my doubts) that it will be fast enough. Alternatives could be to do it on the compressed data (?) or make it, non real-time.. but this takes a bit of the fun out of it.<br><br>Project Schedule:<br><br>I will use a week or two to get to know Kamaelia and how it is structured.<br>Then I will make a class for a generic encoder / decoder and unit tests for those. This should take no more than a week.<br>The different formats should be quite simple to implement if pymedia is as easy to use for other formats than mpeg. I would think a maximum of two weeks to implement and document the components.<br>After this a example of how the components should be made. Depending on how intuitive the Kamaelia framework is to use, this should take a couple of days, maybe a week depending on the complexity of the example.<br>This should leave two to four weeks to work on more format components and a real-time filter component.<br><hr width='100%'><br>
