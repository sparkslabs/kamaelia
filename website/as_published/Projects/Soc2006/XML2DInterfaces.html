<h1>SoC Project: XML Definition and CSS style styling of Pygame (2D) Based Interfaces</h1>
<p>There were 2 project applications in this area that are summarised
here. This page contains the depersonalised content, which can be
consolidated as necessary. The depersonalisation is for privacy
reasons, credit is here due to those who spent the time writing these
descriptions. <br></p><h3>Project Title: XML-defined interfaces in Kamaelia</h3>Benefits to Kamaelia:<br>First, XML/CSS interfaces allow for standardization between programs; everyone can write an interface in exactly the same format. Second, XML and CSS are simple markup languages, so a non-coder could easily define an interface without understanding Python. This is useful even for people who know Python, because the content and formatting data can be kept separate.<br><br>Synopsis:<br>This project will define a standard and reusable format for writing interfaces using XML and CSS. The project also includes writing a component for Kamaelia that will interpret the files for display.<br><br>Specifically, these formats will allow interfaces to be built from standard components and reused without writing code, useful for interface designers. It will solve the problem of proper z-ordering and enforce separation between content and formatting.<br><br>Deliverables:<br><br>Will deliver:<br>- XML format for the interface widgets<br>- CSS format to describe the appearance of the interface widgets<br>- A component for Kamaelia that will interpret the XML and CSS interface files<br><br>Given sufficient time:<br>- A separate GUI program for creating interfaces that will export to the XML/CSS interface format that I define.<br><br>Project Details:<br>The first step will be defining the XML and CSS formats. This will include a version so that the specifications can easily updated without breaking applications. Separation between content (XML) and formatting (CSS) will be strictly enforced.<br><br>Using the format in Kamaelia will be almost as simple as loading an XML file. Each tag in the file will define a widget or group of widgets, and name or id attributes will differentiate between individual widgets, so that they can be controlled from the program.<br><br>The XML file will reference one or more CSS files to control the formatting, layout, and general appearance of the window and its contents.<br><br>The real work this project requires is of course the Kamaelia module. The component will probably use a pre-existing XML-python class such as XMLObject[1] to load in the data, which will save time. A preliminary search didn't turn up a similar library for dealing with CSS markup, so writing a CSS parser may be a part of this project. Once the data is in a convenient (Python) format, the actual widgets can be built. This will be entirely automated; a single function call should take care of it as far as a user of the Kamaelia framework is concerned. After the interface is built, instantiated widgets can be found in a dictionary of names, where the names are defined in the XML file as attributes. Using the widgets will be just like it already is, mainly it is the way they are created needs to change.<br><br>Finally, I think it would make this code much more useful if I coded a basic GUI editor that would output XML and CSS files for use with the new formats. This would make it even easier for non-programmers to work with programmers who are using the Kamaelia framework.<br><br><hr width='100%'><br><br><h3>CSS-esque Styling and XML Layout Definition of Pygame Applications</h3><div style="float: right; border: solid;" class="twoC"><i> Editor: This is one of the smallest applications that
was useful - it's milestones are *just* sufficiently broken down to be
considered of use</i></div> I realize that this project really should start with a discussion but the application window is closing today and I thought it was important to get this application in first.<br><br>Right now I have a concept for this project that is probably a bit too vague but I think we can come up with a solid spec in the first week or two.<br><br>Milestones:<br>  May - Completed spec. All modules/classes should have skeletons. Experiment with different XML/stylesheet/gui libraries. Adjust milestones.<br>  June - Define XML DTD/schema and code up basic parser/event handler.<br>  July - Implement CSS (or other stylesheet) system. Get some users to beta test.<br>  Aug. - Bugs, Docs, Example code, Docs, Bugs, Docs.<br>  <br>I know this timeline is rather vague but until we agree on a detailed spec I don't feel comfortable making any promises.<br>  <br><hr width='100%'><br><br>
