<h3>News</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><b>May 2008</b> - Project revamp - the project has continued under active development since the last news updates. Specifically a new iteration of the website is planned for release which should pull in more dynamic information more obviously. This is to coincide with a new release in June 2008, based on merging work currently sitting in Kamaelia branches.<br><br></li><li><b>April 2008</b> - Project Mailing Lists have moved to Google Groups. You can find the <b><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia">Kamaelia group here</a></b><br><br></li><li><b>November 2006 - Website Revamp</b><br>The
website is undergoing a revamp at present - mainly to be online
edittable rather than just offline. This should start to have some
positive effects :-)<br><br></li><li><b>October 2006 - Kamaelia in December's <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/">Linux Format</a></b><br>Michael
has written an article on Kamaelia for this month's Linux Format - on
sale October 19th. It covers how to install and use the <a href="../../../Whiteboard/">Whiteboard</a>
application as well as basics of how to write components when building
systems. The article will appear on this website when the magazine goes
off sale! <br><br></li><li><b>October 2006 - Kamaelia Mega Bundle 1.4 released!</b><br>The Kamaelia Mega Bundle has been updated for Kamaelia 0.5 and Axon
1.5.1. It includes the key dependencies that we've tested the code
with, specifically for components that make use of these external
libraries. (Kamaelia is usable without these, but they are nice :-) <br>
 <br>
Libraries included: Axon, Kamaelia,
BitTorrent, dirac, Dirac (python bindings), Imaging, libao, libogg, libvorbis, pyao, pycrypto, pygame, pymedia, PyOpenGL,
Pyrex, pySpeex, python-dvb3, speex, vorbissimple <br><br></li><li><b>October 2006 - Kamaelia 0.5.0 Released!</b><br><br>Kamaelia 0.5.0 marks a major stepping point for the Kamaelia project.
It means we officially have half the capabilities we see ourselves
expecting to have when we hit version 1.0, and also marks the first
release where the number of external contributors to the release
outweighs developers from inside the BBC, meaning this release really
does belong to the Google summer of code of code students who worked on
it. <br>
 <br>
Key highlights of this release: <br>
Bit Torrent support; Open GL support; Nascent seaside style webserver
(sessions controllable by resumable components/coroutines), massively
enhanced DVB support, collaborative whiteboarding with audio (via
speex) supporting daisychaining of whiteboards (since whiteboards are
servers &amp; clients), and enhanced visual system composition (ability
to compose arbitrary graphs now). All of these include examples,
including an Open GL interface to bit torrent, a bit torrent based
simple (non-robust yet) streaming system, and a "record for me" PVR
that you give the channel, and programme names to and it figures out
the rest. <br><br></li><li><b>October 2006 - Axon 1.5.1 Released!</b><br>Highlights include:<br>Useful
changes for a number of threaded components in the Kamaelia 0.5.0
release.  Synchronous boxes (size limited) are now supported by threaded
components. Furthermore, synchronous boxes can now also pause
themselves should the need arise. <br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: 600;">September 2006 - Meet us at </span><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Euro OSCON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 600;">!</span></li><div><a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/euos2006/view/e_sess/9563"><img src="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/images/euos2006/banners/speakers/129x60.gif" align="right"></a>Our project admins will be attending EuroOSCON in Brussels.
