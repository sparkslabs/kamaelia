<h1>Kamaelia 0.6.0 Release Notes<br></h1><h2>Common changes, due to Axon changes:</h2>
<pre>
   * Components now get default configuration via class
     attributes.
   * Allows for a more declarative approach of specialising
     entire systems without code duplication or over use of
     inheritance.  (localisation of change)
</pre>


<h2>DELETED FILES</h2>
<pre>Kamaelia/Util/passThrough.py
   - Was deprecated in 0.5.0 in favour of Kamaelia.Util.PassThrough

     of its inboxes.

Tools/VideoReframer/VideoReframer.py
   - This is a command line tool that decodes a video clip; applies
     edit decisisions (cutting, cropping and scaling); and re-encodes
     it. The idea is to cut and crop video to make it suitable for

     the data to.

     This component is therefore useful for building systems that
     are self rate limiting - systems that are just trying to
     process data as fast as they can and are limited by the speed
     of the slowest part of the chain.

Kamaelia/File/UnixProcess2.py

     pipes.
Kamaelia/Internet/UDP_ng.py
   - Experimental new UDP components that use the selector to 
     awaken them (ie reduce CPU usage).
   - Note, if useful, the contents of this file will replace the
     standard UDP.py file.
   - Adds UDPSender, UDPReceiver

Kamaelia/Internet/TimeOutCSA.py

     overriding the appropriate methods (primarily the
     shouldWeAcceptMail method).

Kamaelia/Apps/Grey/MailHandler.py
   - Abstract SMTP Mailer Core
     This component effectively forms the skeleton of an SMTP
     server. It expects an SMTP client to connect and send
     various SMTP requests to it. This basic SMTP Mailer Core
     however, does not actually do anything in response to
     any of the SMTP commands it expects.

Kamaelia/Apps/Grey/ConcreteMailHandler.py
   - Concrete Mail Core
     This code enforces the basic statemachine that SMTP
     expects, switching between the various commands and
     finally results in forwarding on the SMTP command to the
     appropriate SMTP server. By itself, this can be used as a
     simple SMTP Proxy server.

Kamaelia/Apps/Grey/WakeableIntrospector.py
   - On Demand/Wakeable Introspector
     This component grabs a list of all running/runnable

     "inbox". This list is then sorted, and noted to a logfile.

Kamaelia/Video/CropAndScale.py
   - Video frame cropping and scaling
     This component applies a crop and/or scaling operation
     to frames of RGB video. Requires PIL - the python
     imaging library. http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Kamaelia/Video/DetectShotChanges.py
   - Detecting cuts/shot changes in video
     DetectShotChanges takes in (framenumber, videoframe)
     tuples on its "inbox" inbox and attempts to detect where
     shot changes have probably occurred in the sequence. When
     it thinks one has ocurred, a (framenumber, confidencevalue)
     tuple is sent out of the "outbox" outbox.

Kamaelia/Video/PixFormatConversion.py
   - Converting the pixel format of video frames
     These components convert the pixel format of video frames,
     for example, from interleaved RGB to planar YUV 420.

   - namespace changes:
        Kamaelia.Apps
        (Enables reuse of Whiteboard code in other apps potentially
         within limits)


Tools/Compose.py
   - Largely disabled by changes since 0.5.0, but with good reason.
      - lots of code cleanup, and uses a new introspection method
        regarding the repository based on parsing the component
        definitions rather than imports.

Kamaelia/File/Reading.py
    - Documentation and introspection fixes

Kamaelia/File/BetterReading.py
   - namespace change:

    - Documentation &amp; examples added
    - SimplePeer implementation simplified
    - TargettedPeer output form is now (data,(host, port))
    - PostboxPeer now expects data of form: (host,port,data)

    - Changes to support removeReader, removeWriter
    - Now supports SSL connections, via SSLSocket
    - ConnectedSocketAdapter:
       new inbox: "makessl": "Notify this CSA that the socket
         should be wrapped into SSL",
       new outbox: "sslready": "Notifies components that
         the socket is now wrapped into SSL",
    - Various internal improvements
    - Much improved shutdown handling
    - self.scheduler.stop() can now shutdown a server cleanly,
      including attempting to close all open sockets, and pass
      shutdown info to protocol handlers etc
    - Data send queue no longer has an internal buffer unless
      absolutely necessary.
    - Adds author sylvain hellagouache

Kamaelia/Internet/TCPServer.py
    - Changes primarily to improve shutdown handling.
       - See cookbook for examples.
    - Change to use (self.CSA) (for example) rather than use
      ConnectedSocketAdapter directly - allowing for override of
      the specific CSA by users of this class.

Kamaelia/Internet/Selector.py
   - Improved shutdown handling. (No sockets being managed for
     5 seconds == shutdown)

   - select timeout changed from 5 seconds to 0.05 seconds. This
     makes the system more responsive to shutdown requests

Kamaelia/Internet/TCPClient.py
   - Changed to support the SSL support in the CSA
   - Better shutdown handling.
   - New inbox: makessl : Notifications to the
     ConnectedSocketAdapter that we want to negotiate SSL
   - New outbox: sslready : SSL negotiated successfully
   - More correct support for errors on windows

Kamaelia/BaseIPC.py

   - Documentation improvements. NOTE: Many components do not
     use this, and it's use is limited to the HTTP code primarily.
     It may or may not be useful to you.

Kamaelia/Experimental/Services.py
   - Metadata added

Kamaelia/Chassis/ConnectedServer.py
   - Documentation changes
   - Shutdown improvements
   - Change from just SimpleServer to ServerCore and SimpleServer

         peer, peerport, localip, localport
   - New inbox: _socketactivity : Messages about new and closing
     connections here
   - ServerCore configuration changed to allow TCPServer to be
     easily overridden by a user.

<h1>Axon Release Notes: 1.6.0</h1><h2>New Files &amp; Functionality<br>
</h2>
<pre>Index: Axon/Handle.py</pre>
<pre><br>Rewritten replacement for LikeFile. Intended to be used with<br>Axon.background. Handle and code using it is experimental at<br>present. See Examples/Handle for how to use this.<br><br>Handle is specifically designed to allow you to use Kamaelia components<br>and subsystem in non-kamaelia systems. It does this by providing you<br>with a "Axon.Handle" which is conceptually similar to a "file handle".<br>The interface allows you to start components in the background, and<br>read from it's outboxes, and write to it's inboxes in a non-blocking<br>fashion.<br><br>The fact that it's non-blocking does mean that exceptions can be thrown<br>if the component isn't ready for some reason, but this is intentionally<br>similar to talking a non-blocking file handle.<br><br>Note: whilst Handle is conceptually similar to a file handle, since you<br>have multiple data sources and data sinks inside a component, the interface<br>is not the same as the file interface since it wouldn't be appropriate.<br>However, given the usage style is similar, that's why the name of this<br>facility is "Handle".<br><br>Limitations:<br> * It currently will only allow access to components with the<br>   default/standard inboxes of inbox/control/signal/outbox.<br> * This is a known limitation, but covers a wide class of situations.<br><br>Please look at the examples for details.<br><br>Index: Axon/background.py<br>    * This provides facilities for running the Axon scheduler in a<br>      background thread. This is useful for integrating Kamaelia code<br>      with non-Kamaelia based systems - especially those that MUST own<br>      the primary thread (eg various windowing systems).<br>    * Expected to be used with Axon.background.<br>    * Please see Examples/Handle for examples of usage.<br>    * Simplest usage:<br>          from Axon.background import background<br>          from Kamaelia.UI.Pygame.MagnaDoodle import MagnaDoodle<br>          import time<br><br>          background = background().start()<br><br>          MagnaDoodle().activate()<br>          while 1:<br>              time.sleep(1)<br>              print "."<br><br>Index: Axon/STM.py<br>   * Support for basic in-process software transactional memory.<br><br>   * Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a technique for allowing<br>     multiple threads to share data in such a way that they know when<br>     something has gone wrong. It's been used in databases (just called<br>     transactions there really) for some time and is also very similar<br>     to version control. Indeed, you can think of STM as being like<br>     variable level version control. (If you ignore history and are<br>     just after version numbers(!))<br><br>   * This is provided for those times when you really DO need to share<br>     values between threads/component.<br><br>Index: Axon/experimental/_pprocess_support.py<br>   * The internals of this are strictly private from an API perspective.<br>     It's actually based on an older version of Axon.Handle which works<br>     sufficiently well for Axon.experiment.Process, but not for general<br>     support. (essentially it's the old Axon.LikeFile code, which was<br>     experimented with between Axon 1.5 and 1.6)<br><br>Index: Axon/experimental/Process.py<br>   * Provides the core for multiprocess support in Kamaelia.<br>     Specifically provides ProcessPipeline and ProcessGraphline. At<br>     present thse are limited in the inboxes/outboxes you can use for<br>     linkages to just inbox/outbox/control/signal. This is a<br>     limitation, but sufficient in many contexts.<br>
Index: Examples/STM/Philosophers.py<br>   * An example of how to implement dining philosophers with pure<br>     python threads and Axon's STM code.<br><br>Index: Examples/STM/Axon.Philosophers.py<br>   * An example of how to implement dining philosophers with<br>     Axon ThreadedComponents and Axon's STM code.<br><br>Index: Examples/SystemShutdown.py<br>    * Example of how to use the new self.scheduler.stop() facility in<br>      Axon, both in terms of shutting down the system and also in terms<br>      of shutting down components that don't actually support shutting<br>      down directly.<br><br>Index: Examples/Handles/TestHandle.py<br>    * An acceptance test for using Axon.Handle to act as a manual<br>      intermediary between 2 Kamaelia components in a non-Kamaelia<br>      system.<br><br>      Ie read from this one, pass onto that one - core of the code for<br>      that is this:<br>           while 1:<br>               time.sleep(1)<br>               try:<br>                  data = TB.get("outbox")<br>                  print data<br>                  message = data<br>               except Queue.Empty:<br>                  pass<br>               TD.put(message, "inbox")<br><br>Index: Examples/Handles/reverser.py<br>   * And example of how to use Handle with a trivial component that<br>     reverses lines of data passed to it.

(ie improvements to unpausing<br>      when message taken from outbox)<br>      (hence removal of stuffWaiting flag)<br>    * Unpauses on recv from inbox.<br>    * Unpauses on send to outbox<br>    * Minor changes to improve responsiveness when pausing<br><br>Index: Axon/debugConfigDefaults.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br><br>Index: Axon/Axon.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Removed the metaclass created __super() method<br>      convenience function - it's been deprecated for<br>      a long time since there's boundary issues where<br>      it would go wrong.<br><br>Index: Axon/AxonExceptions.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br>    * New exception: BoxAlreadyLinkedToDestination<br>      The inbox/outbox already has a linkage going *from* it<br>      to a destination.<br><br>      Possible causes:<br>          - Are you trying to make a linkage going from an<br>            inbox/outbox to more than one destination?<br>          - perhaps another component has already made a<br>            linkage from that inbox/outbox?<br><br>Index: Axon/Microprocess.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br>    * Added extra argument to microprocess, specifically tag=<br>      this allows the name of the microprocess to be tagged.<br>      This is useful in conjunction with WaitComplete and The<br>      Introspector and pausing to understand why a piece of<br>      code is staying in a particular WaitComplete loop/state.<br>    * When .stop() is called the microprocess, it's scheduler<br>      is set to a null scheduler.<br>    * Extra error messages when you call WaitComplete with a<br>      function rather than a generator. (you should only pass<br>      a generator object into WaitComplete, rather than a<br>      function).<br><br>Index: Axon/Linkage.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br>    * Extra debugging provided in the case of trying to make a<br>      link from an outbox that doesn't exist. This is possible<br>      to do accidentally by having a trailing comma in the<br>      linkage description. (So this possible causes is<br>      described in the error message)<br><br>Index: Axon/Ipc.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br>    * Signature of WaitComplete changed from:<br>       def __init__(self, *args):<br>       to <br>       def __init__(self, *args,**argd):<br>       Copies of args/argd copied in as attributes. <br><br>Index: Axon/debugConfigFile.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br><br>Index: Axon/util.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Documentation improvements.<br><br>Index: Axon/Scheduler.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br>    * import os<br>    * Signature changed to include **argd rather than no args.<br>    * Added "wait_for_one" attribute<br>       - Means the scheduler can be started without any<br>         components/microprocesses being ready to run.<br>    * Added in a stopRequests queue (for safely recieving<br>      method calls from users of the system)<br>    * The wait_for_one class flag causes an internal flag to<br>      note that we have to wait for at least one microprocess<br>      to start before the scheduler exits.<br>    * New method waitForOne to allow the same flag to be set<br>    * This flag is cleared when a new microprocess is started.<br>    * listAllThreads method now switches on local debugging as<br>       well.<br>    * Handling of WaitComplete extended to allow passing<br>      through any tag provided by the user. Otherwise a default<br>      tag is created based on the parent's microprocess name.<br>    * Support for .stop() requests changes the logic in the<br>      main loop for the scheduler to allow clean shutdown and<br>      exit of loops. After exitting the main loop, the<br>      scheduler calls the .stop() method of all<br>      microprocesses &amp; components in the run queue.<br>      One key use case for this is to allow clean close and<br>      shutdown of TCP sockets when someone calls<br>      self.scheduler.stop()<br>    * The self.stop() method however doesn't directly<br>      maniplate this flag, but in fact updates a threadsafe<br>      queue. The reason for that is to allow threaded<br>      components as well as generator components to cleanly<br>      call this method.<br><br>Index: Axon/AdaptiveCommsComponent.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br>    * Change to _AdaptiveCommsable.__init__ signature to<br>      support class based system configuration.<br>    * addOutbox defaults to also ensuring that the<br>      self.unpause callback gets added as the notification<br>      callback when a message is removed from an outbox.<br>    * Change to AdaptiveCommsableComponent.__init__ signature<br>      to support class based system configuration.<br><br>Index: Axon/CoordinatingAssistantTracker.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Major documentation improvements.<br>    * New .zap() method to clear the services and information<br>      logged by the co-ordinating assistant tracker. This was<br>      added to assist with multiple process support.<br><br>Index: Axon/debug.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Documentation improvements.<br><br>Index: Axon/idGen.py<br>    * Documentation changed to REST format<br>    * Documentation improvements.<br><br>Index: setup.py<br>    * Annotated slightly to assist building targetted<br>      application tar balls.<br><br>Index: CHANGELOG<br>+<br>+   * Added support for *basic* software transactional memory<br>+    * Software transactional memory is a fancy phrase for something<br>+      that boils down to something similar to version control for<br>+      variables. You can checkout the current state, make modifications<br>+      and try to commit them back. If the commit succeeds, you<br>+      successfully updated it. If it doesn't, you didn't.<br>+<br>+      This implements it, and provides a mechanism for making the CAT<br>+      safe for threads to use as well as standard components.<br>+<br>+    Added in LikeFile --&gt; renamed to Handle<br>+    Added in support for monkey patching the internals of a component<br>+    system.<br><br>+1.5.1 -&gt; 1.x.x<br>+    An exception is now raised if you try to create a linkage going<br>+    from an inbox/outbox that already has a linkage going from it.<br>+<br>+    Waking up of producer components re-introduced (bugfix)<br>+<br>+    * When a component collects a message from an inbox; all producer<br>+      components with outboxes linked to that inbox will be woken.<br>+<br>+    Additions to the Axon Test Suite providing test coverage of this<br>+    facility.</pre>
