    <h3>Kamaelia based systems</h3>
&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<!-- 5 Kamaelia systems... (<a href="/KamaeliaApplications.html">more here</a>) -->

<h3><a href="/KamaeliaGrey.html">Kamaelia Grey</a></h3>

<p>Spam reduction through greylisting. Kamaelia Grey is a SMTP proxy for your inbound email, rejecting email likely to be spam. Mail likely to not be spam is forwarded to your normal mail server.

</p><h3><a href="/ActiveFileProcessor.html">Batch Transcoder</a></h3>
<p>This watches directories for new images and videos to transcode to formats suitable for the web. You can think of it as the backend needed for a youtube/flickr type site. PDF support is likely to be added soon.

</p><h3><a href="/Whiteboard.html">Whiteboard</a></h3>
<p>A collaborative whiteboard. 2 or more machines share a display you can write on - either can be a server. Whiteboards are paginated, and therefore can also be used for remote presentations. Really cool with a tablet.

</p><h3><a href="/ERModeller.html">ER Modeller</a></h3>
<p>Built to allow modelling a database. You describe the entities and their attributes, and relationships. Also allows entities to inherit from each other. Uses a customised topology visualiser to show you your design.

</p><h3><a href="/KamaeliaMacro.html">Macro</a></h3>
<p>Records and transcodes digital TV for later viewing (ie timeshifting). It can do this for as many channels at once as you have CPU power and tuners available for it.

<!--
<h3><a href="/Logger">Logger</a></h3>
<p>It's an IRC bot, but it's also an IRC channel logger. It's simple, effective, and could easily be extended to do more interesting things. It is however useful and used to log #kamaelia on freenode.

<h3><a href="/Introspector">Introspector</a></h3>
<p>Kamaelia systems are inherently introspectable. This is a tool you can attach to a Kamaelia system and see what it is doing inside. This enables visual debugging.

<h3><a href="/Compose">Compose</a></h3>
<p>This is the flipside of the introspector. It uses a visual approach for composing Kamaelia objects into systems.

<p>Documentation is a core asset in Kamaelia. It is continuously being
extended and improved.

</li></ul>

<h3><a href="/Cookbook.html.html">Cookbook</a></h3>
<p>This section contains a number of recipes showing how to build a variety of different types of Kamaelia systems. Sections include:
</p><ul>
<li>Linking components together
</li><li>Building Network systems, clients, servers, IM, etc
</li><li>Building Digital TV systems
</li><li>Building Multimedia systems
</li><li>Using Kamaelia components &amp; subsystems in non-kamaelia systems.
</li></ul>
<p><b>More recipes always welcome.</b>

</p><h3><a href="/Components.html">Component Reference</a></h3>
<p>Full component reference. This is automatically generated <b>nightly</b>, and where tests exist, the output of the tests is parsed and included on these pages. <br></p><h3><a href="/Docs/.htmlAxon/Axon.html.html">Axon Reference</a></h3>
<p>Full reference for Axon - the core of Kamaelia. This is also automatically generated nightly and also includes test output.</p><p>

    <h2>Community</h2>
<h3>Kamaelia is open source, help us improve it!</h3>
&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<h3><a href="/Developers/">Developer Central</a></h3>
<p>Interested in helping out? You're more than welcome! In this area you'll find some pages which cover some areas of interest for ongoing dev, our general development process, project management process, guidelines on contributing (eg smart questions, through to code, and contributor agreements)

</p><h3><a href="/Contact.html">Get Help (Contact)</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes the best contributions happen when someone asks the right question. Please don't be afraid to ask (or answer!) questions. We'd love to help you, and merely ask that you help others in return. Not much of a community otherwise? :) (OK, not everyone has time to do that) Find us on <a href="/mailinglists.html">email</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia">google groups</a>, <a href="/irc.html">irc</a>, etc

</p><h3><a href="/SummerOfCode.html">Summer of Code</a></h3>
<p>We've been involved with GSOC now for 3 years, and it's been great. One of the less obvious things about GSOC is that it's generated a wealth of docs and ideas which can be dived into here.

</p><h3><a href="/Repository.html.html">Source &amp; SVN</a></h3>
<P> Kamaelia's source is hosted on <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/kamaelia/">code.google</a>, and the latest
release is the <a href="http://www.kamaelia.org/release/MonthlyReleases/Kamaelia-0.9.8.0.tar.gz">0.9.8.0
release</a>. (Y.Y.M.r). Some <a href="/release/">apps are also available in the release
directory.


</p><h3><a href="/Wiki.html">Wiki</a></h3>
<p> This entire site is powered by, essentially, a wiki engine, if you're interested in contributing please get in <a href="/Contact.html">contact</a> and drop us a line. (It doesn't default to open to avoid wikispam, etc) <b> ie: Think this site could do with improving? Please help! :) </b>
