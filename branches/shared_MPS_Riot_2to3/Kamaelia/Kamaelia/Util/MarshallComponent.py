Legacy stub for BasicMarshallComponent
======================================

The functionality of this component has been superceeded by the Marshaller and
DeMarshaller components in Kamaelia.Util.Marshalling. Please use these in
preference.

This component contains both marshalling and demarshalling facilities. It is
a thin wrapper combining a Marshalling and DeMarshalling component.



Example Usage
-------------

None at present.



How does it work?
-----------------

Behaviour is consistent with that of Kamaelia.Util.Marshalling, except that the
"inbox" inbox and "outbox" outbox are not used.

Marshall data by sending it to the "marshall" inbox. The marshalled data is
sent to the "marshalled" outbox.

Demarshall data by sending it to the "demarshall" inbox. The marshalled data is
sent to the "demarshalled" outbox.
