1.0.2 -> 1.0.3 - Performance Improvements
   * Split debug.debug.debug/debug.debug.note into two halves:
      * areDebugging(self,section,level)
        This performs the check to see if we're debugging at a specific
        level
      * debugmessage(self, section, *message)
        This outputs the specific message with associated debug formatting.

   * All functions in Axon (more or less - couple of exceptions) changed
     over to use the new style debugging approach. Means that in order to
     have sensible runtime speed you no longer have to run with python -OO
     flags.

1.0.1 -> 1.0.2
   * Fixes for example in README, pulled out into an Examples directory.

1.0 -> 1.0.1
   * Distribution now included initial version of combined docs. This needs
     santisation.
