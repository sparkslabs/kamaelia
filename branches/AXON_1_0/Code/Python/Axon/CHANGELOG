1.0.3 -> 1.0.4 - Debugging reactivated, Microprocess enhanced
     Debugging subsystem re-activated for actual use. Still needs a bit
     of work. (Ideally we should *merge* the debugging selected in the
     debug.conf file with the defaults, rather than have them replace
     the defaults)

     Microprocess has gained a "run" method, which allows a microprocess to
     be run standalone. (This should assist with testing)

     self.link now returns the linkage created. This allows the user to do
     the following when debugging a system:
       l = self.link( ... )
       l.setShowTransit(True)

     All usage of __super removed. It will disappear completely in 1.0.5

1.0.2 -> 1.0.3 - Performance Improvements
   * Split debug.debug.debug/debug.debug.note into two halves:
      * areDebugging(self,section,level)
        This performs the check to see if we're debugging at a specific
        level
      * debugmessage(self, section, *message)
        This outputs the specific message with associated debug formatting.

   * All functions in Axon (more or less - couple of exceptions) changed
     over to use the new style debugging approach. Means that in order to
     have sensible runtime speed you no longer have to run with python -OO
     flags.

1.0.1 -> 1.0.2
   * Fixes for example in README, pulled out into an Examples directory.
     (Thanks to: "Gangadhar NPK" <npk.gangadhar at gmail dot com>)

1.0 -> 1.0.1
   * Distribution now included initial version of combined docs. This needs
     santisation.
