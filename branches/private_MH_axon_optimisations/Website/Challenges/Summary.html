<p>The key aim is to pull people's awareness towards specific key problems which are thought to be very difficult, but achievable in a decade or two.</p>
<p>The sheer scale and scope of the problems caused by 20-60 million different items of content to be viewed <span style="font-style:italic">simultaneously</span> from the BBC, potentially online is a challenge that should be undertaken, but should not be undertaken lightly.</p>
<p>There <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> BBC projects underway looking at these challenges, but the scope of this document is larger. The challenges laid out in this document will exist, and need resolving - whether the BBC does it or asks industry to help. Clearly the ultimate solution will be a mix of both in areas of appropriate expertise.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:22pt;font-weight:600">[[pullleft]Meeting Challenges]</span></p>
<p>BBC R&amp;D projects exist that seek to address some of the issues laid out here. The <a href="http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/">Kamaelia</a> &amp; <a href="http://dirac.sourceforge.net/">Dirac</a> projects are aimed specifically at the some of the challenges in this document. BBC and Industry collaborations such as <a href="http://www.hitech-projects.com/euprojects/share_it/">Share It!</a> have been looking at issues related to these challenges. Some of these challenges naturally fit elsewhere with other groups.</p>
<p>However, the reality is that the BBC and industry cannot assume that the public will follow. P2P has shown that the Internet Community - that is anyone competent, willing and connected to the network - will go their own way if the public is not involved. There is almost always a better way.</p>

<p>[[pullleft]The style of this document is inspired by the &quot;<a href="http://www.bcs.org/BCS/Awards/Events/GrandChallenges/conferencereports.htm">Grand Challenges in Computing</a>&quot; documents produced by UK Academia. These grand challenges have a long history. One notable success in recent times has been the Human Genome Project. A project that was successful at driving forward state of the art, but that which ultimately failed in it's original goal was Hilbert's Grand Challenge to Mathematics around 1900.]</p>
