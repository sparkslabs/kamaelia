This directory contains the same components as were in example2's
SimpleStreamingSystem, except packaged up as client and server. 

If you try running these on the same system (on a single CPU system), it
should be clear that both try to hog the CPU of the machine they're running
on - this exhibits itself as audio jitter.

Essentially the problem that you're seeing is due to the system competing
with itself rather than collaborating with itself.

By comparison if you run the server & client on different machines (this
will need changing the remote address in the client) you should not have
this issue.
