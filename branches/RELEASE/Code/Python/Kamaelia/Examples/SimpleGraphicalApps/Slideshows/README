This example is a simple demonstration of the pygame 'window manager' style
wrappers. It implements a simple slideshow of images, controlled by clicking
'next', 'prev', 'first' and 'last' buttons.

It utilises the PygameDisplay component to provide a pygame display service.
Button 'widgets' send messages to a 'Chooser' component that supplies
filenames to the Image 'widget' for display.


Also, unlike traditional slideshow/presentation tools, you can modify this
to run arbitrary components. An example of how this can work is provided -
allowing stepping through some graph visualisations along with the
presentation.
