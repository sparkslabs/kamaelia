<p align="right"><span style="font-size:18pt">Please use this for your application</span></p>
<p>If you want to propose a summer of code project, please use the following as a template. It focusses on the information we would like to see.</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>[[pre]<span style="font-weight:600">Name:</span> Please include your email address<br /><span style="font-weight:600">Project Title:</span><br /><span style="font-weight:600">Timezone:</span> (this is an issue for practicality)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:600">Benefits to Kamaelia:</span> (or BBC, or BBC Research, or Dirac - should always<br />relate to benefit to the audience) <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:600">Synopsis:</span> 2 paras (maybe 3)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:600">Deliverables:</span><br /><br />This is best described in terms of what components you'd expect to deliver<br />and what they'd do, along with documentation, and tests as appropriate.<br /><br />Divide these into 2 categories: &quot;will deliver&quot; and &quot;given sufficient time&quot;.<br />These are what you'd consider &quot;musts&quot; and &quot;would like to haves&quot;. These<br />don't have to be complex.<br /><br />I would aim to be simple here. Maybe 4 clear components you might already<br />have an idea how to implement (even if they take a weeks), but are the core<br />of much more useful components. The given sufficient time components are <br />things you'd like to see yourself implementing, but aren't sure you can<br />definitely do in the time available. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:600">Project Details:</span><br /><br />How you'll progress through the project, what tools and libraries you'll use.<br /><br />What particular benefits this project will achieve (eg how to use FOO in<br />Kamaelia, and perhaps FOO in general). (Where FOO is your project)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:600">Project Schedule:</span><br /><br />What you will do, roughly in what order so we can have an idea of<br />at what phase you should be. You could also expect to include a time line<br />indicating what deliverables or stages (alpha/beta/etc) you expect to<br />be at or have delivered by certain dates.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:600">Brief Bio:</span><br /><br />In here I will really need to have a clear idea of your experience with the<br />various /relevant/ technologies and so on. (I've seen some bios that<br />have focussed purely irrelevent infomation).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:600">References:</span><br />Links to anything you might deem relevant.</div>
