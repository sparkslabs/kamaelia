Main Kamaelia Tree:

    Index: Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/GSOCPaint/Core.py

        Core paint layer. Derived from Magnadoodle. For this to be generally
        useful, really needs to be replaced by the Whiteboard's canvas.

    Index: Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/GSOCPaint/Paint.py

        Confusing. Should this even be here? Looks like an earlier iteration.

    Index: Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/GSOCPaint/Button.py

        Docs are incorrect, need deleting.
        Creates an ImageButton component by subclassing component.
        ImageButton would be useful to rework for general use.
        
    Index: Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/GSOCPaint/__init__.py

        To allow import

    Index: Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/GSOCPaint/Slider.py

        New component, appears to be derived from XYPad, which acts as a slider.
        I have a suspicion that it's actually trying to do too much.

    Index: Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/GSOCPaint/ColourSelector.py

        Again derived from XYPad, suggest refactoring. Used to represent colours
        from the RGB spectrum as square with RG, GB, RB along the edges, and
        colurs generated in the plane. Would be reuseful to rework for general
        usage.

    Index: Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/GSOCPaint/UI/XYPad.py

        Maybe the original XYPad written by Joe. Need to check this and check
        it's actually used. If it isn't actually used, need to delete it really.

    Index: Kamaelia/Kamaelia/Apps/GSOCPaint/ToolBox.py

        This is the "Tool box" window for GSOC Paint, it brings together
        all the widgets used by the paint app and places them on a surface.


    Index: Kamaelia/setup.py
        Adds in pulling in the GSOC Paint namespace.
