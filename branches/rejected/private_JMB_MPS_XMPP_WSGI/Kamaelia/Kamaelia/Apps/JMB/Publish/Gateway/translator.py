========================
Translator (Gateway)
========================

Translators are designed to take a request from the HTTP server (using the
WSGILikeTranslator) and turn it into a message that can be sent out via headstock.
It also takes a message from headstock and turns it into a response that can be
sent out by the HTTPServer.

There are three subcomponents in a Translator: A RequestSerializer, a
ResponseDeserializer, and a Controller.  The RequestSerializer takes the incoming
HTTP request and turns it into a form that can be sent to the peer.  The
ResponseDeserializer takes a message from the Peer and turns it into a form that
can be sent to the page requester by the HTTPServer.  The Controller does most of
the signal handling and is responsible for receiving signals and forwarding them
to the appropriate components.

How does it work?
------------------

The system is made to connect to a pair of backplanes (via a PublishTo component
of course).  The first service that it subscribes to will connect to the interface's
inbox.  This is used to send the interface messages to be sent out to the peer.
The second backplane is used to connect to the interface's control inbox.  This service
is used by the Translator to register itself with the interface and to notify the
interface that it's done.

You probably don't need to instantiate either the RequestSerializer or
ResponseDeserializer directly.  You should instead call the factory function
Translator, which will automatically create the components and link them.  Note
that it is possible to change the RequestSerializer or ResponseDeserializer in
the Translator funcion, but be aware that they must use the same interface as the
components they replace.

What is crosstalk?
--------------------

Cross talk is a way of passing data back and forth between the gateway and the peer
It is basically a dictionary that roughly maps to a CGI environment-like dictionary
that has been serialized into JSON (using simplejson).  There are a few other fields
that may be in a crosstalk message.

- 'batch' is the "series" of messages a message is a part of.  Each HTTP request
and its associated response (together referred to as a "transaction") are assigned
a batch id.  This ID will be used to determine which "conversation" a message belongs
to.  This is the id that the interface will use to determine which translator to
send a message to.  The batch id also corresponds to the XMPP thread ID.

- 'signal' will be present to signal certain things.  Presently, it is used to
notify the peer when the gateway has transmitted the entire HTTP request (formatted
into crosstalk) and by the Peer to signal when the entire HTTP response has been
transmitted.

- 'body' will contain a chunk of the body or the body in its entirety.

The batch ID must be in all crosstalk messages while the signal and body fields may
be in the initial message, a separate message, or may not even be in the same message
(the Translator will currently send signal in a message by itself.)

For more info on CGI environment variables that may be present, see the following
webpage:  http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html

In additon to the standard CGI variables, the following variable may also be present:

- 'NON_QUERY_URI' represents the URI without the query string.  For example, the
URI /a/b/c?d=e would give a NON_QUERY_URI of /a/b/c

What is JSON?
--------------
JSON may sound like an intimidating thing, but it's not.  It's a data serialization format
sort of like XML, only less verbose and simpler.  In fact, if you're reading this,
you're probably already familiar with a significant amount of its syntax.  For example,
you can do this at the python command line (assuming you have simplejson installed):

>>> import simplejson
>>> x = {'a' : 'b', 'c' : 'd', 'e' : 'f'}
>>> simplejson.dumps(x)
'{"a": "b", "c": "d", "e": "f"}'
>>> simplejson.dumps(y)
'["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]'
>>> z = {'a' : ['b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], 'f' : ['g', 'h', 'i', 'j']}
>>> simplejson.dumps(z)
'{"a": ["b", "c", "d", "e"], "f": ["g", "h", "i", "j"]}'


You'll notice that the formatting is almost identical to the way that Python prints
out string representation of basic objects.

What else will be done to the message?
--------------------------------------

The message will be gzipped to be smaller, and will then be base64 encoded to
prevent any text in the message from invalidating the XML that will be used by
XMPP.
