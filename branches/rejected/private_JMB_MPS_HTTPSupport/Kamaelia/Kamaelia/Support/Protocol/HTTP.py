This is a module of utility functions to be used with the HTTP server.

Request Translators
-------------------
Sometimes it is helpful to have the parsed HTTP request come in a different format.
With a request translator, you may have the format of a parsed HTTP request changed
before it gets to your handler.  You may use the function ReqTranslatorFactory to
create a factory function that will create your handler using the request translator
you specify automatically.

FIXME: This makes sense if the user has a conceptual model of a translation
FIXME: happening. However, they don't. If they're expecting to get "the
FIXME: parsed HTTP request" in "a different format" then actually they just
FIXME: expect you to use a different *formatter* rather than translator. If
FIXME: indeed "format" even makes sense as a word in this context.
FIXME: 
FIXME: As a result, the very naming here needs reviewing and rethinking.
FIXME: 

ReqTranslatorFactory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXME: See the reservations about this below. However, it's worth noting:
FIXME: It isn't used by the HTTP Server. It's used by the HTTP Server
FIXME: Protocol component. It also says "requests will be formatted". If
FIXME: that's the case, then it's not a translator, it's a formatter
FIXME: (matching verbs makes the docs clearer)
FIXME: 
FIXME: The argument names are bad as well. An API is used over and over
FIXME: again, and should be designed to be *read*. Using short variable
FIXME: names like this is problematic since it favours the function writer
FIXME: rather than the function user. (There are exceptions - recv is easier
FIXME: for people that receive vs recieve for example, but I read this and
FIXME: thought "hand ?")

This function will make a factory that can create handlers for the HTTP Server
If this is used, the requests coming in to that handler will be formatted using
the given translator.
  
  hand - a factory function that returns a handler to be used by the HTTP
  Server
  trans - a function that takes a request and returns a translated dictionary
  to be used by the handler.
  
WSGILikeTranslator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXME: Similar comments to above hold

This function will translate the HTTPParser's syntax into a more WSGI-like syntax.
Pass it to the HTTPProtocol factory function and requests will be sent to your
resource handler with a subset of a WSGI environ dictionary.  You just need to
supply more of the wsgi variables (like wsgi.input).

  request - the request to be translated
  
This function will return the translated dictionary.

ConvertHeaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXME: See comments in the code. Basically the name here makes little sense.

Converts environ variables to strings for wsgi compliance.  Also puts the 
request headers into CGI variables.

  request - The request as formatted by the HTTP Server
  environ - the WSGI environ dict to contain the converted headers
  
Popping request dictionaries
-----------------------------

FIXME: This comment has a falacy - it states that "popping a URI" is a
FIXME: common task. It isn't. It's rather peculiar to this codebase, and
FIXME: needs description clearer as to what specifically this means - I can
FIXME: think of several meanings. It doesn't state either what changes or is
FIXME: returned based on what.

A fairly common practice in dealing with HTTP dictionaries is to "pop" a URI.
That is to say, to move one level down in the webserver's "Filesystem."  The main
function for doing this is PopURI, which requires you to manually specify the keys
to use from the dictionary.  Also provided are PopKamaeliaURI and PopWsgiURI.

PopKamaeliaURI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIXME:  Similar issues

This is a function to pop a level from the PATH_INFO key into the SCRIPT_NAME
key of a WSGI-like dictionary.

  request - a WSGI-like dictionary
  
PopWsgiURI
~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIXME:  Similar issues

This is a function to pop a level from the uri-suffix into the uri-prefix-trigger
key of a request dictionary.

  request - a request dictionary

HTTP Protocol
--------------

FIXME: This is very badly named, as noted elsewhere. Docs need rewriting to
FIXME: actually reflect what's happening. This may involve changing
FIXME: component names.

FIXME: (and putting in compatibility names whilst merging code which has
FIXME:  already been written to allow this code not to break the existing
FIXME:  code that uses these names)

These functions are included to simplify using the HTTPServer.  Instead of instantiating
an HTTPServer directly, you may wish to use the included HTTPProtocol factory function
if you are using the HTTPServer with ServerCore.  You may also use the requestHandlers
function to generate a createRequestHandler function to pass to the HTTPServer.

To use HTTPProtocol with ServerCore, use the following:

from Kamaelia.Support.Protocol.HTTP import HTTPProtocol
from Kamaelia.Chassis.ConnectedServer import ServerCore
from Kamaelia.Protocol.Handlers.Minimal import MinimalFactory

routing = [['/', MinimalFactory('index.html', 'htdocs')]]
ServerCore(
    protocol=HTTPProtocol(routing),
    port = 8080,
    socketOptions=(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)).run()
    
HTTPProtocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXME: Same problem as the inline doc string. It doesn't do what is said
FIXME: here - not even slightly.

This function will generate an HTTP Server that may be used with ServerCore.

  routing - An iterable of iterables.  Each item in the main iterabe may be thought
    of as an entry in the HTTPServer's "routing table."  An entry's syntax is roughly
    as follows:
      [
          ...
          [<URI prefix>, <Handler factory>]
          ...
      ]
      
    See above for example syntax.
  errorPages - A component to create in the event of an error.  That component's
    __init__ function must accept two arguments:  the error code (as an integer)
    and a message to be displayed (although it can ignore these if it so chooses)
    
requestHandlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIXME: See the inline problems raised with this below.
This function will generate a createRequestHandlers function for use with HTTPServer

  routing - An iterable of iterables formatted the same as HTTPProtocol.
  errorPages - A component to create in the event of an error.  That component's
    __init__ function must accept two arguments:  the error code (as an integer)
    and a message to be displayed (although it can ignore these if it so chooses)

Misc
-------
These are various other functions:

CheckSlashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIXME: See the inline problems raised with this below.
This function will make sure that a URI begins with a slash and does not end
with a slash.

  item - the uri to be checked
  sl_char - the character to be considered a 'slash' for the purposes of this
            function # FIXME: why is this even configurable?
