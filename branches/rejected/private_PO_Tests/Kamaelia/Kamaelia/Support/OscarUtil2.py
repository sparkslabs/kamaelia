OSCAR Utility functions
=======================
This file includes functions for dealing with OSCAR datatypes and passwords.

This is the second of two utility modules. OscarUtil is the other. Most of
the AIM components require both OscarUtil and OscarUtil2. All the code in this
module was originally written for Twisted or is derived from Twisted code. 

Original Maintainer: U{Paul Swartz<mailto:z3p@twistedmatrix.com>} for Twisted
