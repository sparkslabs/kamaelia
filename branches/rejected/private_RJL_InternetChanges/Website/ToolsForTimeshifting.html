<p>This is the directly related to the current focus of some of our work. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Note: </span>Timeshifting is defined (in the UK), along the lines of as being you recording something at your home off the TV for you to watch (probably once) at a more convenient time. One of the spin offs from some existing internal work will be that it provides a number of tools that make timeshifting easier. Please note, this page won't contain any legal advice, and these tools are <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> provided for legal timeshifting! If you've any doubt what these terms mean, or think you might get it wrong, please consult a lawyer ! If you're located in a country where timeshifting isn't protected by law, don't use these tools.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">The simplest PVR possible</span></p>
<p>Use cron to run and kill the following program at an appropriate point in time:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>[[pre]#!/usr/bin/python<br /><br />from Kamaelia.DVB.Simple import DVB_Channel_Tuner<br />from Kamaelia.File.Writing import SimpleFileWriter<br /><br />multiplex_frequency = 538 # In MHz. This will vary for your area<br />video _pid = 701 # Channels are multiplexed and video streams are given a programme id (pid)<br />audio_pid = 702 # Audio is separated out from video in DVB multiplexes.<br />recording_filename = &quot;programmge.mpg&quot;<br /><br />pipeline(<br />      DVB_Channel_Tuner(multiplex_frequency, [video _pid, audio_pid]),<br />       SimpleFileWriter(recording_filename)<br />).run()<br />]</div></ul>
<p dir="ltr">The resulting file might then need some conversion for playback by your favourite media player (obviously you'll delete the programme after watching it).</p>
