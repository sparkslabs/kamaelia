<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-style:italic">What terms and conditions may the source code be used? </span></div></ul>
<p>Kamaelia is released under the Mozilla trilicense scheme (MPL/GPL/LGPL). Specifically you may choose to accept either the Mozilla Public License 1.1, the GNU General Public License 2.0 or the Lesser General Public License 2.1. </p>
<ul type="disc"><div>See also: <a href="COPYING">COPYING</a></div></ul>
<p>If commercial parties wish to discuss alternative licensing please contact us.</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Please note though: since you can choose to accept the LGPL this means that you can use Kamaelia code in any project of your choice without releasing your code, as long as you don't change any Kamaelia or Axon code. Due to the nature of Python and Python libraries we don't count simple inheritance (that is <span style="font-family:Courier">class foo(component): ...</span> ) as modification to Kamaelia or Axon.</li></ul>
<p>Essentially this boils down to this:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>If you change any of the code that is part of the Kamaelia project as part of your project and release your project, then the recipient of that project should recieve a copy of Kamaelia and the changed code.</li></ul>
