=======================
Triggered File Reader
=======================

This component accepts a filepath as an "inbox" message, and outputs the
contents of that file to "outbox". All requests are processed sequentially.

This component does not terminate.

Drawback - this component uses blocking file reading calls but does not
run on its own thread.
