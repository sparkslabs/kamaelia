=======================
Simple multicast sender
=======================

A simple component for sending data to a multicast group.

Remember that multicast is an unreliable connection - packets may be lost,
duplicated or reordered.



Example Usage
-------------

Multicasting a file to group address 1.2.3.4 on port 1000 (local address 0.0.0.0
port 0)::

    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader("myfile", rate=100000),
              Multicast_sender("0.0.0.0", 0, "1.2.3.4", 1000),
            ).activate()



More detail
-----------

Data sent to the component's "inbox" inbox is sent to the multicast group.

This component ignores anything received on its "control" inbox. It is not yet
possible to ask it to shut down. It does not terminate.

This component never emits any signals on its "signal" outbox.
