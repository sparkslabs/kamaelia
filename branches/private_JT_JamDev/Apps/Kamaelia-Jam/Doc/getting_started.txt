====================================
Getting started with Jam and PureJam
====================================

So, you've downloaded Jam, navigated the (slightly skimpy) install
instructions.  You've started up it up, marvelled at the beautiful UI, clicked
a few buttons.  But now you'd really quite like to hear some sound out of it.
Well, you've come to the right place.  Or rather you haven't, because by itself
Jam doesn't actually make any sound.  Instead it outputs OSC messages which are
understood by a number of other programs which will make sound out of them.
For a (incomplete) list of programs which support OSC messages see
http://opensoundcontrol.org/implementations.  This brief guide will take you
through making your first music using Jam and PureData.

PureJam
-------

To assist you with getting started making music using Jam there is a patch for
Pure Data (http://www.puredata.info), PureJam.pd, which is included in the
standard distribution of Jam.  It is recommended that you use one of the
PD-extended builds of Pure Data available from http://puredata.info/downloads,
otherwise some or all of PureJam may not work.

When you have Pure Data installed open up PureJam.pd (it will probably live in
either /usr/share/kamaelia/jam/PureJam.pd or
/usr/local/share/kamaelia/jam/PureJam.pd), and you should see a number of boxes
- these are the PD objects which will interpret the OSC messages and make the
sound.  At the top you will also see four drum samples which are loaded into the
patch for you to play with.

To get started, first ensure audio is turned on (from the Media menu), then
start up Jam.  Try turning on some of the steps in Jam's step sequencer.  You
should hear the samples being played when the position marker (at the top of the
sequencer) is above the step.  Next try moving the first XY pad around.  This
controls the delay time and feedback of a simple delay line which all of the
drums are routed through.  Congratulations!  You are now up and running
programming drums with Jam.

There are a number of comments in the PureJam patch describing how it works.
Using them, and the documentation at http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/Pd_documentation/
try altering the PD patch to change the sound it makes.  You will soon
find that you can shape the sound made using Jam in a number of unexpected ways.
Have fun experimenting!
