This interface is pretty simplistic at present. As time progresses it would
be nice to extend this to have a more file reading type properties.

Specifically, the following could happen:
   * Rather than "getAudio", change simply to "read".
   * Implement file seeking type properties, with seeking possible by both
     time and filesize.
   * Change the record type we want to read from just bytes (as is the
     current default to either packets, pages or blocks).
   * Change the decode buffer to have additional information currently
     thrown away - such as page/packet index/count, time start/end (if
     available). Change the ogg_vorbis_context to allow access to the info and
     comment fields - currently not accessible.
