Branches get deleted from here after being merged. If you need to restore
one for whatever reason, you can do this as long as you have the last
revision number where it did exist.

That's the reason for this file - so that you can find out that information.
Not all the branches below will have been deleted. However they are the ones
the system "knows" about.
