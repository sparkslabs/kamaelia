<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer Of Code 2006</a> has now finished. It has been fantastically successful for Kamaelia. We are immensely grateful to Google for this opportuntiy and have all enjoyed ourselves immensely. Our students have produced some great work, including:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Modular HTTP Server</li>
<li>Bittorrent client</li>
<li>OpenGL capabilities</li>
<li>Key authentication infrastructures</li>
<li>Speex codec bindings</li></ul>
<p>We will post more information on these projects shortly. The plan is to incorporate these into our main codebase as soon as possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you feel you've missed out this year - stick around - we welcome new developers, code and ideas. Take a look at the [[HREF][location=/cgi-bin/projects/blog.cgi]project ideas] that were discussed - many are still important areas we would like to work on, so if you are interested, please do [[HREF][location=/Contact.html]get in touch]. You don't have to wait for next year's Summer of Code!</p>
