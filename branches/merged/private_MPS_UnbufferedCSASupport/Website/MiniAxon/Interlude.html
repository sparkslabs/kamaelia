<p dir="ltr">So far we've created a mechanism for giving a generator some implicit context by embedding it inside a microprocess class. We've also created a simple microprocess that repeatedly displays the same message over and over again. We've also created a simple mechanism for setting lots of microprocesses running and watching them just go.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is all well and good and core aspects of Axon. However another core aspect is enabling these generators to talk to each other. Doing this means we can divide responsibility for a task between file reading, and display. The metaphor we choose to use in Axon is a very old one - that of a worker at a desk with a number of inboxes and a number of outboxes. The worker receives messages on his/her inboxes. He/She does some work, and send results on his/her outboxes. We can then have something that takes messages from an outbox (called saying &quot;finance&quot;) and delivers them to the inbox of somewhere else (say the inbox &quot;in&quot; on the finance desk/component). </p>
<p dir="ltr">An alternate analogy we don't take here is one of computer chips with pins and wires. Signals would get sent to pins transmitted along the wires (links) to other pins on other chips. A more software oriented alternative is unix pipelines and standard file descriptors. A unix command line program always* has access to stdin, which it reads but has no idea of the source; stdout  it can write to, but has no idea of destination (and stderr). Obviously however unix command line programs don't know if they're in a pipeline, or standalone. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The key point we have is <span style="font-style:italic">active </span>objects talking only to local interfaces, and not knowing how those local interfaces are used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So the next step is to first create this standard interface for external communications, and then a mechanism for allowing communication between these interface. </p>
