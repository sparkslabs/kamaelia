1.1.2 -> 1.5.0
    Major subsystem changes aimed at performance enhancements

    MESSAGE PASSING AND DELIVERY OPTIMISATION CHANGES
 
    * Boxes are now discrete objects. This change has occured to enable the
      use of direct (effectively "zero copy" delivery).

    * This has meant the postman has been deleted - components no longer
      have a postman associated with them. This also dramatically frees
      up CPU cycles for components rather than the communications system.

    * To replace the structural tracking, a "postoffice" class has been
      created instead. This, however, is passive rather than active.

    * Because the death of a component no longer also means the death of a
      postman, microprocess has been simplified to remove the concept of
      activity creator. This removes the knock on complexity in both the
      scheduler and inside Component.

    * Despite these changes components running on top of Axon (ie existing
      Kamaelia components) operate largely unchanged. (A few that assumed
      the existance of a postman etc have changed)

    THREADING SUPPORT

    * The threaded component has had its API fixed to match the rest of
      Axon (with the obvious exception of removing the yields).

    FLOW CONTROL INVERSION

    * The Scheduler therefore now dynamically builds its runqueue to only
      include unpaused (active) microprocesses.

    * If there are no active microprocesses, the scheduler can now sleep.
      Reducing CPU usage to zero, until some kind of event causes something to
      wake up. Flow of control is therefore effectively inverted as Axon systems
      can now be reactive.

    * Pausing state is now managed by the scheduler on behalf of microprocesses
      (they used to manage it themselves). Requests to wake and pause
      microprocesses get routed to the Scheduler.

    * The APIs for Component and Microprocess are, for the most part, unchanged.
      Existing components will continue to work as before. If they self pause
      they will benefit from reduced CPU usage. If all components 

    Bug fix to make Wait* work cleaner

    Axon.Component.Component
    * Default documentation for Component class in/out- boxes added
    * anyReady() added. Returns true if any has data in it.


    Axon.Microprocess.Microprocess
    * Can activate an arbitrary thread of control from a generator
      (The thing you normally call .next() on)
    * Can pass on a closeDownValue
    * Can be set as an activity creator
    * Now conditionally starts the thread. Actually helps with re-entrant
      calls inside a single active microprocess.

    Axon.Scheduler.Scheduler
    * Now handles shutdown knockons more gracefully
    * Removal of lots of debugging code no longer needed (hasn't been needed
      in a long while)
    * Code cleanup

    Axon.Ipc
    * Added the shutdown message. This can be used to request that an Axon
      component should simply shutdown. This does not force the component
      to shutdown, merely requests it.

     
1.1.1 -> 1.1.2
     Instated use of ctypes to use posix.sched_yield during the main loop.
     This makes the system a *little* bit more other-system friendly.

     Added in the ability to do, effectively, blocking calls to other
     components. The best example using this at present in
         Kamaelia.UI.Pygame.Ticker

     Specifically you can ask the system to run a different microprocess in
     the place of the running one, and wait until it ends.

      yield WaitComplete(
          self.requestDisplay(DISPLAYREQUEST=True,
                              callback = (self,"control"),
                              size = (self.render_area.width, self.render_area.height),
                              position = self.position
                              )
      )

     Where self.requestDisplay is a generator with the following behaviour:

         def requestDisplay(self, **argd):
            displayservice = PygameDisplay.getDisplayService()
            self.link((self,"signal"), displayservice)
            self.send(argd, "signal")
            for _ in self.waitBox("control"): yield 1 ## This could also be rewritten in this form :-)
            display = self.recv("control")
            self.display = display

     This is experimental support that is likely to evolve with time. This
     does however allow effectively for a far more co-routine type behaviour
     than we had in place before - rather than generator type behaviour.

1.1.0 -> 1.1.1
     Change made to Microprocess that massively simplifies Kamaelia scripts
     that are just pipeline systems. For example, the following is now all
     that's needed for a pipeline system:

     pipeline(TCPClient(tickerIP,tickerPort)
              Ticker()
             ).run()



1.0.3 -> 1.1.0 - Debugging reactivated, Microprocess enhanced

     Added the facility to allow components to be wrapped threads rather
     than wrapped generators. Since this is a major addition, that's why
     the version has been bumped to 1.1.0

     All usage of __super removed. It will disappear completely in 1.2.0

     Microprocess has gained a "run" method, which allows a microprocess to
     be run standalone. (This should assist with testing)

     self.link now returns the linkage created. This allows the user to do
     the following when debugging a system:
       l = self.link( ... )
       l.setShowTransit(True)

     Debugging subsystem re-activated for actual use. Still needs a bit
     of work. (Ideally we should *merge* the debugging selected in the
     debug.conf file with the defaults, rather than have them replace
     the defaults) (Decent docs for debug subsystem still to come)



1.0.2 -> 1.0.3 - Performance Improvements
   * Split debug.debug.debug/debug.debug.note into two halves:
      * areDebugging(self,section,level)
        This performs the check to see if we're debugging at a specific
        level
      * debugmessage(self, section, *message)
        This outputs the specific message with associated debug formatting.

   * All functions in Axon (more or less - couple of exceptions) changed
     over to use the new style debugging approach. Means that in order to
     have sensible runtime speed you no longer have to run with python -OO
     flags.

1.0.1 -> 1.0.2
   * Fixes for example in README, pulled out into an Examples directory.
     (Thanks to: "Gangadhar NPK" <npk.gangadhar at gmail dot com>)

1.0 -> 1.0.1
   * Distribution now included initial version of combined docs. This needs
     santisation.
