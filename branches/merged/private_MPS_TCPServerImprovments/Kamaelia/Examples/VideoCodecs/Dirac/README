Simple dirac encoder and decoders.

In order to get some source material for the encoder, first decode the
original dirac content included and pipe to a file rather than to a
display. If your re-encode and re-encode you should expect the image to
degrade. (like any lossy codec :)

In order to use these encoders/decoders, you need to be using dirac 0.5.4,
or 0.6.0. Other versions are not yet supported. This is due to the fact
that the dirac bitstream isn't finalised yet.
