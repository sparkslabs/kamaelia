This directory contains the multicast transceiver version of the TCP based
simple streaming server in examples 2 & 3. If you are running this on a
single system, then you will want to run the "System" version. If you are
running this on 2 or more machines, you will want to run the server on one
of them, and clients on the rest. If you wish the server to also be a
client, simply run the "System" version, on that and clients on the rest.

However!

START THE CLIENTS FIRST - this is partly due to a limitation in ogg vorbis.

(Codebooks are stored just once in the stream, so clients joining a stream
halfway through have to deal with this problem by getting the codebook
packets from elsewhere, amongst other problems.)

Furthermore, expect the stream to be *very* choppy if you are using the
client/server scripts seperately on a machine that isn't a linux machine
using ctypes.

Also we now include a simple layer of reliability in the SRM version of this
system. This shows how you can layer protocols easily on top of each other.
(In many respects this also simplifies testing/creation of protocols)
