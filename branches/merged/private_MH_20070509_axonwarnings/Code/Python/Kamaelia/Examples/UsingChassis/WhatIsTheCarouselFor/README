PlayMP3.py / PlayMP3s.py
     * Simple MP3 player - uses a Carousel to instantiate the audio Output
       component at runtime with parameters read from the decoded audio.
     * PlayMP3s.py plays a playlist of mp3 files one after the other.
     * Requires PyMedia

SimpleMultiFileStreamer.py
     * Simple streamer that repeatedly streams (3 times) the same audio
       file.
     * This is a mainly a demonstration of how to use the
       JoinChooserToCarousel Chassis, and the
       FixedRateControlledReusableFileReader
     * What really happens is a "chooser" takes a playlist of things to
       serve, and the filereader asks the chooser what file it should be
       reading next when it finishes reading a file.

ClientStreamToFile.py
     * Simple client for the above streamer
