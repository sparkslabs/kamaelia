This directory will contain little snippets of code which are intended as
helper hints as to how code can evolve/be used or ad hoc tutorials for SoC
people. (It struck me that a piece of code was *almost* a component already,
so I componentised it to show how this can be done, and realised that this
would probably be a useful idea in general)
