================================================
Run components one after the other (in sequence)
================================================

A Seq component runs components one after the other in sequence, waiting until
one terminates before starting the next.

Strings can also be put in the sequence. They'll be printed to the console



Example Usage
-------------

Run several OneShot components running one after the other::

    Pipeline( Seq( "BEGIN SEQUENCE",
                   OneShot("Hello\\n"),
                   OneShot("Doctor\\n"),
                   OneShot("Name\\n"),
                   OneShot("Continue\\n"),
                   OneShot("Yesterday\\n"),
                   OneShot("Tomorrow\\n"),
                   "END SEQUENCE",
                 ),
              ConsoleEchoer(),
            ).run()

Running this generates the following output::

    BEGIN SEQUENCE
    Hello
    Doctor
    Name
    Continue
    Yesterday
    Tomorrow
    END SEQUENCE



Behaviour
---------

Each component in the sequence is activated as a child component and is wired up
so that the "inbox" inbox and "outbox" outbox are forwarded to the "inbox"
inbox and "outbox" outbox of the Seq component itself.

When the child component terminates it is replaced with the next in the
sequence.

If a string is listed instead of a component then it is printed on the console
and Seq immediately moves onto the next in the sequence.

Any messages sent out of the child component's "signal" outbox are dropped - 
this is so that if you Pipeline a Seq component to another, it does not cause it
to terminate when the Seq component switches to a new child.

This component ignores any messages sent to its "control" inbox.

When the end of the sequence is reached, a producerFinished() message is sent
out of the "signal" outbox and the component terminates.
