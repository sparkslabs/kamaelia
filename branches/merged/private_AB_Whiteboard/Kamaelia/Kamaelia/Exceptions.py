General Kamaelia Exceptions
===========================

This module defines a set of standard exceptions generally useful in Kamaelia.
They are all based on the Axon.AxonExceptions.AxonException base class.


The exceptions
--------------

* **BadRequest(request, innerexception)** - signalling that a request caused an
  exception``self.request`` is the original request and ``self.exception`` is
  the exception that it caused to be thrown
  
* **socketSendFailure()** - signalling that a socket failed trying to send

* **connectionClosedown()** - singalling that a connection closed down

* **connectionDied()** - signalling that a connection died
  * connectionDiedSending()
  * connectionDiedReceiving()
  * connectionServerShutdown()
