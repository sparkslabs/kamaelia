RTP Header
==========

This class provides a representation of the fixed RTP Headers as per
section 5.1 of RFC1889. The following attributes on an RTPHeader object
represent the fields in the header:

   version,padding, extension, CSRCCount, marker, payloadtype
   sequencenumber, timestamp, SSRC, CSRC

The order of the fields and sizes are defined in the variable "struct".
