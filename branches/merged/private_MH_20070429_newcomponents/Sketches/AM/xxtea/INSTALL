In order to install the xxtea module
cd libxxtea/src
make

You need to have Pyrex installed in order to build the python bindings.
If you don't already have this, do the following
   * Grab pyrex - we used Pyrex-0.9.2.1.tar.gz here
   * tar zxf Pyrex-0.9.2.1.tar.gz
   * cd Pyrex-0.9.2.1
   * python setup.py install

Then you build and  install the python bindings:
   * cd python
   * python setup.py install
