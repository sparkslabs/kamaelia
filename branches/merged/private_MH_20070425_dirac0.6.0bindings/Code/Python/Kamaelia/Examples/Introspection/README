This is a simple modification of an earlier incarnation of Example 2's
SimpleStreamingSystem.py.

It expects you to have the AxonVisualiser already running, and then allows
you to look inside the running simple streamer. 

Due to the AxonVisualiser being CPU intensive, this can result in the audio
sounding choppy. However this does allow you see what's going on inside the
system.
