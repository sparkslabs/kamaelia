This directory contains libvorbissimple and some basic python bindings.
2 sample programs are included using the libraries:
   * simple_decoder.c
   * simple_decoder.py

Both programs do the same thing, but in different languages. The python
version is 60% slower/more CPU intensive that the C version. It is however
more than 60% shorter.
