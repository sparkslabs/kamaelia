This archive contains the following files:

   * README - this file.

   * VorbisBytesToBeeps.pdf - this is a tutorial/explanation about how to
     build a hypothetical simple decoder (with a reusable core) using
     libvorbis. 

   * src/simple_decoder.c - The main harness for the simple decoder using a
     reusable core.

   * src/libvorbissimple.c - A simple *source code* library forming a reusable
     core. 

   * src/BUILDING - small set of instructions detailing how to build the
     decoder - covers the compile/link stages.

The code forming the simple_decoder was directly derived from the existing
sample decoder - as a result this code/docs is covered by the same license
as the original decoder.

(The contents of this directory has also been contributed back to Xiph.org)

December 2004: Added to Kamaelia's sourceforge project since it documents in
detail the basic architecture and design ideas behind libvorbissimple -
which is wrapped as a sample Kamaelia codec decode component.
----------------------------
Update: March 2006

This document and the library have proven to be useful for nearly 2 years
now. This README was part of an archive only containing the files below.
However it serves as pretty good documentation to the standard library
code which is included in the upper directories as well. 

The off to Xiph for the code and documentation still stands as you would
expect. This document is, as far as we're aware, still the only
documentation for using libvorbis which we've found. Any corrections from
anyone very welcome and will be merged as soon as humanly possible!
