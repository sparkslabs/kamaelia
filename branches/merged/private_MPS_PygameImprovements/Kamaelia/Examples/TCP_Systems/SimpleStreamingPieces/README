This directory contains the same components as were in example2's
SimpleStreamingSystem, except packaged up as client and server. 

If you try running these on the same system (on a single CPU system), it
should be clear that both try to hog the CPU of the machine they're running
on - this exhibits itself as audio jitter.

Essentially the problem that you're seeing is due to the system competing
with itself rather than collaborating with itself.
   * UPDATE: If you are using the latest version of Axon (1.1.1) under linux
     and have ctypes installed, you should not see this since the scheduler
     now calls posix.sched_yield periodically, making it more friendly to
     the OS.

By comparison if you run the server & client on different machines (this
will need changing the remote address in the client) you should not have
this issue.
