This tar ball contains a Kamaelia distribution suitable for running the
Kamaelia tutorial demos.

The pdf for the book (notes) and presentation slides are not included
here as well, but available on the web instead.

The PDF & paper version for the notes is available here:

http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/kamaelia-pragmatic-concurrency/7302222

(PDF is free, paper version is low cost, but postage from lulu is a bit
pricey)

The slides will be available on slide share ASAP.
