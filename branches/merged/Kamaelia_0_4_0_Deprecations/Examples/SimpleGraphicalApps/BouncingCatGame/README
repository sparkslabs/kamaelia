Simple component based game using pygame. Not quite fully integrated with
the other pygame code (will be), but fully reusable & reconfigurable code
and it's a useful start for people wanting to see how to write things
varying from games through other interactive systems.

  * Simple bouncing images game. Designed for very small children who are
    amused by things take beep and react when you press left/right mouse
    buttons.
  * Forms a demonstration of the new BasicSprite and SpriteScheduler
    components, along with the associated EventHandler code, which is a
    substantial subsystem. Shutdown of active bouncing sprites and their
    associated components controlling them is controlled by a fanout
    component. Also contains a nice demonstration of the flexibility of
    Graphline
