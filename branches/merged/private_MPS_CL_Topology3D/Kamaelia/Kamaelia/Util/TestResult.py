===================
Basic Result Tester
===================

A simple component for testing that a stream of data tests true.
This is NOT intended for live systems, but for testing and development purposes
only.



Example Usage
-------------
::
    Pipeline( source(), TestResult() ).activate()
    
Raises an assertion error if source() generates a value that doesn't test
true.



How does it work?
-----------------

If the component receives a value on its "inbox" inbox that does not test true,
then an AssertionError is raised.

If the component receives a StopSystem message on its "control" inbox then a
StopSystemException message is raised as an exception.

This component does not terminate (unless it throws an exception).

It does not pass on the data it receives.

    This IPC message is the command to the component to throw a 
    StopSystemException and bring the Axon system to a halt.
