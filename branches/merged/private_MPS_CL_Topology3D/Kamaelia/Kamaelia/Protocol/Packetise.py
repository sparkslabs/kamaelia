    """\
This is a simple class whose purpose is to take a data stream and
convert it into packets of a maximum size. 

The default packet size is 1000 bytes. 

This component was created due to limitations of multicast meaning packets
get discarded more easily over a certain size.

Example usage::

    Pipeline(
        ReadFileAdaptor(file_to_stream, readmode="bitrate", bitrate=400000,
                        chunkrate=50),
        SRM_Sender(),
        blockise(), # Ensure chunks small enough for multicasting!
        Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 0, "224.168.2.9", 1600),
    ).activate()

This component acts as a simple filter - data is expected on inboxes
and packets come out the outbox. 

This component does not terminate.
