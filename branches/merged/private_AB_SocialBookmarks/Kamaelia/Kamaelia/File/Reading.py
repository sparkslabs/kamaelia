Components for reading from files
=================================

These components provide various ways to read from files, such as manual control
of the rate at which the file is read, or reusing a file reader to read from
multiple files.

Key to this is a file reader component that reads data only when asked to.
Control over when data flows is therefore up to another component - be that
a simple component that requests data at a constant rate, or something else that
only requests data when required.



PromptedFileReader
------------------

This component reads bytes or lines from the specified file when prompted.

Send the number of bytes/lines to the "inbox" inbox, and that data will be read
and sent to the "outbox" outbox.



Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reading 1000 bytes per second in 10 byte chunks from 'myfile'::

    Pipeline(ByteRate_RequestControl(rate=1000,chunksize=10)
             PromptedFileReader("myfile", readmode="bytes")
            ).activate()



More detail
^^^^^^^^^^^
The component will terminate if it receives a shutdownMicroprocess message on
its "control" inbox. It will pass the message on out of its "signal" outbox.

If unable to read all N bytes/lines requested (perhaps because we are
nearly at the end of the file) then those bytes/lines that were read
successfully are still output.

When the end of the file is reached, a producerFinished message is sent to the
"signal" outbox.

The file is opened only when the component is activated (enters its main loop).

The file is closed when the component shuts down.


SimpleReader
------------

This is a simplified file reader that simply reads the given file and spits
it out "outbox". It also handles maximum pipewidths, enabling rate limiting
to be handled by a piped component.

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Usage is the obvious::

    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline import Pipeline
    from Kamaelia.File.Reading import SimpleReader
    from Kamaelia.Util.Console import ConsoleEchoer
    
    Pipeline(
        SimpleReader("/etc/fstab"),
        ConsoleEchoer(),
    ).run()


More detail
^^^^^^^^^^^

This component will terminate if it receives a shutdownMicroprocess message on
its "control" inbox. It will pass the message on out of its "signal" outbox.

If unable to send the message to the recipient (due to the recipient enforcing
pipewidths) then the reader pauses until the recipient is ready and resends (or
a shutdown message is recieved).

The file is opened only when the component is activated (enters its main loop).

The file is closed when the component shuts down.



RateControlledFileReader
------------------------

This component reads bytes/lines from a file at a specified rate. It is
performs the same task as the ReadFileAdapter component.

You can configure the rate, and the chunk size or frequency.



Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read 10 lines per second, in 2 chunks of 5 lines, and output them to the console::

    Pipeline(RateControlledFileReader("myfile", "lines", rate=10, chunksize=5),
             ConsoleEchoer()
            ).activate()



More detail
^^^^^^^^^^^
This component is a composition of a PromptedFileReader component and a
ByteRate_RequestControl component.

The component will shut down after all data is read from the file, emitting a
producerFinished message from its "signal" outbox.

The component will terminate if it receives a shutdownMicroprocess message on
its "control" inbox. It will pass the message on out of its "signal" outbox.

The inbox "inbox" is not wired and therefore does nothing.



ReusableFileReader
------------------

A reusable PromptedFileReader component, based on a Carousel component. Send it
a new filename and it will start reading from that file. Do this as many times
as you like.

Send it the number of bytes/lines to read and it will output that much data,
read from the file.



Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read data from a sequence of files, at 1024 bytes/second in 16 byte chunks::

    playlist = Chooser(["file1","file2","file3", ...]
    rate = ByteRate_RequestControl(rate=1024,chunksize=16)
    reader = ReusableFileReader("bytes")

    playlist.link( (reader, "requestNext"), (playlist,"inbox") )
    playlist.link( (playlist,"outbox"), (reader, "next") )
    
    Pipeline(ratecontrol, reader).activate()

    
Or, with the Control-Signal path linked up properly, using the
JoinChooserToCarousel prefab::

    playlist = Chooser(["file1","file2","file3", ...]
    rate = ByteRate_RequestControl(rate=1024,chunksize=16)
    reader = ReusableFileReader("bytes")

    playlistreader = JoinChooserToCarousel(playlist, reader)
    
    Pipeline(ratecontrol, playlistreader).activate()

    

More detail
^^^^^^^^^^^    

Bytes or lines are read from the file on request. Send the number of bytes/lines
to the "inbox" inbox, and that data will be read and sent to the "outbox"
outbox.

This component will terminate if it receives a shutdownMicroprocess or
producerFinished message on its "control" inbox. The message will be passed on
out of its "signal" outbox.

No producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess type messages are sent by this
component between one file and the next.



RateControlledReusableFileReader
--------------------------------

A reusable file reader component, based on a Carousel component. Send it a
filename and the rate you want it to run at, and it will start reading from that
file at that rate. Do this as many times as you like.



Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read data from a sequence of files, at different rates::

    playlist = Chooser([ ("file1",{"rate":1024}),
                         ("file2",{"rate":16}), ...])
    reader = RateControlledReusableFileReader("bytes")

    playlist.link( (reader, "requestNext"), (playlist,"inbox") )
    playlist.link( (playlist,"outbox"), (reader, "next") )
    
    reader.activate()
    playlist.activate()

    
Or, with the Control-Signal path linked up properly, using the
JoinChooserToCarousel prefab::

    playlist = Chooser([ ("file1",{"rate":1024}),
                         ("file2",{"rate":16}), ...])
    reader = RateControlledReusableFileReader("bytes")

    playlistreader = JoinChooserToCarousel(playlist, reader).activate()



More detail
^^^^^^^^^^^

The rate control is performed by a ByteRate_RequestControl component. The rate
arguments should be those that are accepted by this component.

This component will terminate if it receives a shutdownMicroprocess or
producerFinished message on its "control" inbox. The message will be passed on
out of its "signal" outbox.

No producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess type messages are sent by this
component between one file and the next.



FixedRateControlledReusableFileReader
-------------------------------------

A reusable file reader component that reads data from files at a fixed rate. It
is based on a Carousel component.

Send it a new filename and it will start reading from that file. Do this as many
times as you like.



Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read data from a sequence of files, at 10 lines a second::

    playlist = Chooser(["file1", "file2", "file3", ... ])
    reader = FixedRateControlledReusableFileReader("lines", rate=10, chunksize=1)

    playlist.link( (reader, "requestNext"), (playlist,"inbox") )
    playlist.link( (playlist,"outbox"), (reader, "next") )
    
    reader.activate()
    playlist.activate()

    
Or, with the Control-Signal path linked up properly, using the
JoinChooserToCarousel prefab::

    playlist = Chooser(["file1", "file2", "file3", ... ])
    reader = FixedRateControlledReusableFileReader("lines", rate=10, chunksize=1)

    playlistreader = JoinChooserToCarousel(playlist, reader).activate()



More detail
^^^^^^^^^^^

The rate control is performed by a ByteRate_RequestControl component. The rate
arguments should be those that are accepted by this component.

This component will terminate if it receives a shutdownMicroprocess or
producerFinished message on its "control" inbox. The message will be passed on
out of its "signal" outbox.

No producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess type messages are sent by this
component between one file and the next.
