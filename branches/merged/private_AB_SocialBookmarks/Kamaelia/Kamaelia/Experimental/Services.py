================================================
Components to help build Services (EXPERIMENTAL)
================================================

These components make it easier to build and use public services, registered
with the Coordinating Assistant Tracker.

Note: These components are EXPERIMENTAL and are likely to under go substantial
change


Register Service
----------------

A function that registers specified inboxes on a component as named services
with the Coordinating Assistant Tracker (CAT). Returns the component, so can
be dropped in where you would ordinarily use a component.



Example Usage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create and activate MyComponent instance, registering its "inbox" inbox with the
CAT as a service called "MyService"::
    
    RegisterService( MyComponent(), {"MyService":"inbox"} ).activate()
    
    

How does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method registers the component you provide with the CAT. It register the
inboxes on it that you specify using the names that you specify.



Subscibe To Service
-------------------

A component that connects to a public service and sends a fixed format message
to it requesting to subscribe to a set of 'things' it provides. 



Example Usage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subscribe to a (fictional) "TV Channels Service", asking for three channels. The
tv channel data is then recorded::
    
    pipeline(
        SubscribeTo( "TV Channels Service", ["BBC ONE", "BBC TWO", "ITV"] ),
        RecordChannels(),
        ).run()

The message sent to the "TV Channels Service" will be::
    
    ("ADD", ["BBC ONE", "BBC TWO", "ITV"], ( <theSubscribeToComponent>, "inbox" ) )



How does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Describe more detail here




Connect To Service
------------------

A component that connects to a public service. Any data you send to its inbox
gets sent to the service.



Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::
    
    pipeline( MyComponentThatSendMessagesToService(),
            ConnectTo("Name of service"),
            ).run()



How does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Describe in more detail here.
