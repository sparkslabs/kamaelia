To build the sample decoder, you first of all need to compile the code:

   gcc -I /usr/local/include -O20 -ffast-math -mno-ieee-fp -fsigned-char  -c simple_decoder.c

You then link with the vorbis and ogg libraries:

   gcc -O20 -ffast-math -mno-ieee-fp -fsigned-char -l vorbis -lm -logg -o simple_decoder simple_decoder.o

You can then run the program:

   * To play back an ogg file encoded from a CD:

     ./simple_decoder <some_ogg_file.ogg | aplay -fcd -

Note: You probably want to using the version of libvorbissimple a couple of
directories higher up in real code.
