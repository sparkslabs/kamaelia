KamaeliaLogger

What is KamaeliaLogger?
It's an IRC Logging bot! You stick it in your channel and it records all messages unless they're marked [off] in which case they're "off the record".

How do I install it?
This app is accompanied with some dependancies - Kamaelia and Axon. You don't need to know what these are, just that you'll need them for your bot. If you'd like to know more though check out http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net

1) Unpack the folder! 
	tar zxvf <file you downloaded>
2) Install Axon
	cd Axon
	sudo python setup.py install
3) Install Kamaelia
	cd Kamaelia
	sudo python setup.py install
4) Install the IRC Logger!
	cd Apps/Kamaelia-Logger
	sudo python setup.py install

Cool now we're all install just configuration now.

How do I configure my bot?
Copy the default config file - installed to /etc/kamaelia_logger.conf.dist to a localised version - ie /etc/kamaelia_logger.conf
You then edit the freshly copied config file. The config options are documented in the config file.

How does it work then?
Alrighty, like most configuration files lines marked with # are commented out (not parsed). 
Here you can set the channel, host (IRC Server), name, password (if you need one), and directory to store your logs.
The default directory for storing logs is '.' (Current working directory) So you might want to put them in a more convenient location.
So fill in your respective fields for your requirments. The defaults will let you connect to #kamaelia-test on freenode. 

How do I run my bot?
So you're all configured up? Now just run one of the simple scripts we've attached or alternately start your bot manually with
	cd Apps/Kamaelia-Logger/App
	python KamaeliaLogger.py

When you run your bot it will echo some information for you out to the console, for example the defaults should give you this:

	[]
	['channel', '=', '#kamaelia-test']
	[]
	['name', '=', 'kamlogbot']
	[]
	['host', '=', 'irc.freenode.org']
	[]
	[]
	Logging #kamaelia-test as kamlogbot

This is just to let you know that the bot is working :)
Remember, this is all open source so you can easily add cool new features to your bot. Let us know in #kamaelia on Freenode :-)
Have fun with your bot!
