KamaeliaLogger

What is KamaeliaLogger?
It's an IRC Logging bot! You stick it in your channel and it records all messages unless they're marked [off] in which case they're "off the record".

How do I install it?
This app is accompanied with some dependancies - Kamaelia and Axon. You don't need to know what these are, just that you'll need them for your bot. If you'd like to know more though check out http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net

1) Unpack the folder! 
	tar zxvf <file you downloaded>
2) Install Axon
	cd Axon
	sudo python setup.py install
3) Install Kamaelia
	cd Kamaelia
	sudo python setup.py install
4) Install the IRC Logger!
	cd Apps/Kamaelia-Logger
	sudo python setup.py install

Cool now we're all install just configuration now.

How do I configure my bot?
Copy the default config file - installed to /etc/kamaelia_logger.conf.dist to a localised version - ie /etc/kamaelia_logger.conf
You then edit the freshly copied config file. The config options are documented in the config file.

How does it work then?
Alrighty, like most configuration files lines marked with # are commented out (not parsed). 
Here you can set the channel, host (IRC Server), name, password (if you need one), and directory to store your logs.
So fill in your respective fields for your requirments. The defaults will let you connect to #kamaelia-test on freenode.
