In order to install the vorbissimple extension, you need to install
libvorbissimple first:
   * cd <root of tarball>
   * cd libvorbissimple
   * ./configure
   * make 
   * make install
   * ldconfig

You need to have Pyrex installed in order to build the python bindings.
If you don't already have this, do the following
   * cd <root of tarball>
   * tar zxf Pyrex-0.9.2.1.tar.gz
   * cd Pyrex-0.9.2.1
   * python setup.py install

Then you build and install install the python bindings:
   * cd <root of tarball>
   * cd python
   * python setup.py install
