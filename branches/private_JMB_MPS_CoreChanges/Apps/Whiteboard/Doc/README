=== This file needs writing really ===

** Temporary docs **

Install:
   sudo python setup.py install

Necessary bindings:
   pygame - this is necessary for the drawing surface, etc.

Suggested bindings:
   pyspeex-0.2 - from http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/pySpeex/
   requires pyrex for build. This version works:
       http://www.kamaelia.org/release/deps/Pyrex-0.9.3.1.tar.gz

   These are both included in the deps directory. Note: you do NOT need to
   install these for the whiteboard to work, but the audio features will
   not work if you do not. The whiteboard fails gracefully in this case.

    (For audio chatting over the network and local recording of whiteboard
    sessions. Since you can do presentations this way, it can be pretty
    neat)

Usage:

After install of libraries,

   cd App
   ./Whiteboard.py  # for basic usage

Acting as a server:
   ./Whiteboard.py --serveport [port number]

Acting as a client:
   ./Whiteboard.py --connectto [host ip]:[port number]

Acting as a client to one machine and server for others:
   ./Whiteboard.py --connectto [host ip]:[port number] --serveport [port number]

Recording a session from a whiteboard acting as a server:
   ./WhiteboardRecorder.py [recording_filename] [host ip] [port number]

Playing back a session to a whiteboard acting as a server:
   ./WhiteboardPlayer.py [recording_filename] [host ip] [port number]

Playing an MP3 over a whiteboard session:
   ./MP3Player filename host port

TODO:
   * Allow multiple note pads
   * Interface for saving/loading/recording sessions locally
   * Better file format for recordings.
   * Conversion of recordings to some standard video format(!)
