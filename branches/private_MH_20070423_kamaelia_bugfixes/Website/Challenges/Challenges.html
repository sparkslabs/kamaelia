<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">[[pullleft]Deliver The Archive?]</span></p>
<p>[[pullleft]<span style="font-weight:600">Challenge:</span> How do we deliver a BBC repository, dozens of Terabytes in size, to every home in the UK, regularly refreshed, in a way that copes with disk failures and data loss.]</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">[[pullleft]Content Sharing]</span></p>
<p>[[pullleft]<span style="font-weight:600">Challenge:</span> Provide systems, acceptable to this mature audience. Systems that foster this culture, but <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">ensuring</span> that people are still paid for producing content, whilst recognising that the audience will create a lot of content themselves.]</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">[[pullleft]Proprietary Past, Open Future]</span></p>
<p>[[pullleft]<span style="font-weight:600">Challenge:</span> Open <span style="font-style:italic">systems </span>for media delivery must made to scale to very large scale unidirectional streaming, or else many of the other visions in this document falter.]</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">[[pullleft]P2P and Multicast, Together]</span></p>
<p>[[pullleft]<span style="font-weight:600">Challenges: </span>We need to build new Collaborative ClientHub protocols, allowing integration between broadcast, multicast, P2P systems and our archives. P2P and multicast systems need to be adapted to allow and take advantage of thousands of P2P sources becoming simultaneously active. Security mechanisms such that the audience can trust content is a key issue in such a system.]</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">[[pullleft]Who's Free Lunch is Over?]</span></p>
<p>[[pullleft]<span style="font-weight:600">Challenge:</span> Create a usable system for producing parallel software systems that promotes reuse, resilience, scales on new concurrent hardware platforms, and due to design naturally encourages the design of parallel software systems.]</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">[[pullleft]Moore's Law at Home vs Desire for Quality]</span></p>
<p>[[pullleft]<span style="font-weight:600">Challenge:</span> To find a way of capping the <span style="font-style:italic">need</span> for bandwidth usage on the client end. This may mean that research into higher quality video in smaller and smaller bit rates becomes ever more important to allow the BBC to remove Moore's law from the client side of the equation.]</p>
