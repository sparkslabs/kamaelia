This project did not start in a test first mode unfortunately. We saw the
light around 1/2 way through however which is why some code is clearly test
first and the some is retrofitted. The spirit of development of the features
in the component framework has been driven by usage however - extending it
as needed by specific components - working on a YAGNI principle with very
few exceptions. 

On this basis we feel fairly confident that the functionality of the system
is relatively minimal but complete, but could deserve with a ground up
test-first treatment. For various reasons we're choosing to separate out
the test suite from the actual implementation area.

The reason for language specific directories is because we hope the
techniques taken to be useful in languages other than python as well.
