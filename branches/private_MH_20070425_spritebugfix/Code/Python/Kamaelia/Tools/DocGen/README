Tools for building Kamaelia website documentation
=================================================


./DocExtractor.py

  Tool that processes a codebase and generated a directory
  of HTML files documenting the components, prefabs, and
  (optionally) classes and functions within it.

  See internal doc strings or run with --help option for more info
  and typical command lines used to build Axon or Kamaelia reference
  docs


./TestSuiteRun.py

  Runs a directory of unittest based tests and generates a directory
  of output separated out into lots of separate text files.

  Can be supplied as additional input to DocExtractor.py for inclusion
  of test suite results in the documentation.
