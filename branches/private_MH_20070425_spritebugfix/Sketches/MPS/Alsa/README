The files in this directory are using pyalsaaudio (*):
    * http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyalsaaudio/

This consists of two components so far:
   * Simple recorder
   * Simple player

This allows for the creation of a simple telephony system. Currently these
are Linux only. We really want audio capture under windows and Mac OS X
next. Obviously these won't use alsa, but would be nice to have.
