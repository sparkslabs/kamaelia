This is a simple example of how to build your own packaging. As a result you
may use this freely. I can't place this into the public domain, so I'm
granting the following BSD license instead. If you choose to GPL or BSD your
own work, please comply with this license by simply not removing my name
from the AUTHORS file. You can replace this file with your own license file
instead.

This is the version of the BSD license marked as compatible with the GPL
