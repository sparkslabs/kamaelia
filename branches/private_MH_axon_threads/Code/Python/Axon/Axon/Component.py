"""Kamaelia Concurrency Component Framework.

COMPONENTS

A component is a microprocess with a microthread of control, input/output
queues (inboxes/ outboxes) connected by linkages to other components, with
postmen taking messages from output queues, passing them along linkages
to inboxes.

A microprocess is a class that supports parallel execution using microthreads.

A microthread takes more explanation is a thread of control resulting from
a function of the following form::

   def foo():
      yield 1
      while 1:
         print "this"
         yield 1
         print "that"

'bla = foo()' results in bla containing an intelligent function representing the
thread of control *inside* the function - in this case inside the while loop - that
remembers where the program counter was when control was yielded back
to the caller. Repeated calls to 'bla' continue where you left off.

First call to 'bla()' & you get "this" printed. Next time you get "that" then "this"
printed (when you go back round the loop). The time after that, you get "that"
then "this" printed, and so on.

If you have 10 calls to 'foo()' you end up with 10 function calls that remember
where they were in 'foo()', which run for a bit and then return control back to the
caller. If you repeatedly call all of these function calls, you essentially end up
with 'foo()' running 10 times in parallel. It's these special "position remembering"
functions that get termed microthreads.

Clearly in order to have a microthread, you have to have a piece of code
capable of being called in this manner - ie it yields control back to it's caller
periodically  - this is a what a microprocess in this context. An object that has
a "special method" that can be treated in this manner.

A component puts a layer of wrapper on top of the microprocess, which adds
in input & output queues (inboxes/outboxes). To make life easier, a component
has some wrappers around the "special function" to make user code less
obfuscated. The life cycle for a component runs as follows::

myComponent = FooComponent()   # Calls Foo.__init__() constructor,
                              # which must call super class constructor

'myComponent' gets activated.

When 'myComponent' is activated the following logic happens for the
runtime of 'myComponent' ::

   def runComponent(someComponent):
      result = someComponent.initialiseComponent()
      if result: yield result
      result = 1
      while result:
         result = someComponent.mainBody()
         if result: yield result
      someComponent.closeDownComponent
      yield result
      # Component ceases running

Dummy methods for the methods listed here are provided, so missing these
out won't result in broken code. The upshot is a user component looks like this::

   class myComponent(component):
      count = 0
      def __init__(self,somearg):
         self.__class__.count = self.__class__.count + 1
         self.somearg = somearg
         self.Component() # !!!! Must happen if this method exists

      def initialiseComponent(self):
         print "We can perform pre-loop initialisation here!"
         print "If we created a new component here, we'd have"
         print "     return newComponent[theComponent]"
         print " as the last line of this function"
         return 1

      def mainLoop(self):
         print "We're now in the main loop"
         print "If we wanted to exit the loop, we return a false value"
         print "at the end of this function"
         print "If we want to continue round, we return a true, non-None,"
         print "value. This component is set to run & run..."
         return 1

      def closeDownComponent(self):
         print "We can't get here since mainLoop above always returns true"
         print "If it returned false however, we would get sent here for"
         print "shutdown code."
         print "After executing this, the component stops execution"

This creates a component class which has the default input/output boxes
of "inbox" and "outbox".

# Component - a microprocess with a bunch of input/output queues.
#
# It's only communication with the outside world should be through these
# in/out queues, except for a minority of adaptor components that interact
# with the outside world. (Think stdin/stout/stderr)
#
# All components you create should subclass the component class. At present
# you should be doing subclassing directly in most cases. After performing
# local component initialisation in your   '__init__' function, you should then
# call your super class's (component's) '__init__' constructor to ensure that
# the component is correctly configured. ie do this::
#
#    self.component()
#
# In order for your component to become active, you can either::
#
#    foo = myComponent()
#    foo.activate()
#
# If the scheduler isn't already running. If the scheduler is running, then
# you are creating a component from inside a component. In which case
# at the end of your 'mainBody()' function you need to return the new component
# in a message to the scheduler via::
#
#    return (newComponent([foo]);
#
# Which will then handle activation of the component.
#
# Life cycle of a component:
#
# 1. First your '__init__' method is called - this should set up the component,
#     but not actually do any work, other than pure initialisation. (eg read in
#     a file name from the arguments and store it locally, don't open it at that
#     point)
#
# 2. Your object is then activated at some point. This provides you with a
#     thread of control which you have to hand back. When your object is
#     activated and has a thread of control, you can perform some initialisation,
#     since the method 'initialiseComponent' is then called.
#
# 3. Your object goes into the main loop - your 'mainBody' function forms
#     the body of this loop. If you return a 'newComponent' value, you can
#     activate new components you create. If you return a false value (eg None),
#     then your component will exit this mainloop and go into a closedown state.
#
# 4. Your 'closeDownComponent' method is called next if it exists.
