This is the example/template package for packaging up Kamaelia based
modules, and systems. This is designed to assist you with collaborating
with the rest of the Kamaelia community!

Firstly, remove the following files:
|-- Kamaelia
|   |-- Community
|   |   |-- MPS
|   |   |   |-- Demo.py
...
|-- Tests
|   `-- test_Kamaelia.Community.MPS.Demo.py

And replace with your own tests and code. (name all tests files "test_*"

Secondly, DO CHANGE the following files to match your own details/project:
|-- AUTHORS   **
|-- CHANGELOG   **
|-- COPYING   **
|-- Docs
|   `-- README   **
|-- Kamaelia
|   |-- Community
|   |   |-- MPS   ** directory name(!)
...
|-- MANIFEST.in
|-- README   ** (this file!)
|-- Tests
|   |-- README   **
...
`-- setup.py   ** (description, target filename, etc...)

*** NOTE ***

   In particular, please ensure that COPYING matches your intended license
   for your distribution. The preferred licenses are as follows:
      * The Mozilla tri-license - ie MPL/GPL/LGPL combo - this is the same
        license as the official distribution of Kamaelia.

      * The BSD license. (the COPYING file as included is this license, but
        you will want to edit this to remove a header and change the name in
        the third bullet!) 

        Please note, many systems won't be able to choose this option,
        however components which are standalone, and/or can use a MiniAxon 
        as a test bed can - such as those wrapping external libraries
        (subject to the restrictions of those libraries naturally)

   These are both directly and simply compatible with the main Kamaelia
   distribution license.

   If in doubt, use the MPL/GPL/LGPL combination from the main Kamaelia
   distribution (this ensures compatibility, with the least likelihood of
   you choosing wrong :-).

************

Thirdly, to actually build a distribution, simply type:
   python setup.py sdist

You will then be left with a distribution in "dist", which you can then
share with everyone else. If you need any help with this process, please
email kamaelia-list@lists.sourceforge.net !

Have fun!


Michael.
