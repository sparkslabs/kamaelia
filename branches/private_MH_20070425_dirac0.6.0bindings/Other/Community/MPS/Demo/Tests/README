Please name your testing files beginning with "test". If you do, your tests
can be run automagically by typing "./runtests". For this version of the
demo package, this is a bash shell script, but may be replaced by something
more comprhensive in a later version.

Rather than calling your file "1.t", etc, having a long name is a good thing
since it's easier for someone else to see at a glance what you think you're
testing.
