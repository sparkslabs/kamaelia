Framework for 3D applications for Kamaelia
==========================================

This package contains my contributions to Kamaelia during Summer of Code
2006.

To install the package, do the usual python dance:

    python setup.py install

The package includes a framework for building 3D applications with
Kamaelia which is based on pygame and OpenGL (pygl). A display service
and component base classes for display, movement and event processing
are provided. Some 3D components and widgets (Buttons, Label,
Progressbar, ...) were implemented for demonstration and to be used in
user interfaces.

The display service is compatible with existing pygame components
(Kamaelia/UI/Pygame). Additionally a wrapper component is provided to
position pygame components in 3D space.

Two examples are included to demonstrate how the components can be used
to create 3D applications:

- Checkers          -- A prototype of the checkers (or draughts) boardgame
- TorrentOpenGLGUI  -- GUI for Ryan Lothians Kamaelia BitTorrent package

These examples can be found in the Examples/ folder.
