The player part of this system relies upon the SWF player from this site:

This is OK for many open source & non-commercial systems, however it has a
licensing scheme which means we may well need to find a different player for
a real system since unlike open source licenses, this player *claims* to be
open source, but then says "no commercial use without a paid for license",
which breaches OSI guidelines.

It's unclear whether participate or kamaelia fall into the non-profit
scenarios. (I would say yes, but that's not really for me to say)

(licensing costs are extremely reasonable though - to put it mildly)
