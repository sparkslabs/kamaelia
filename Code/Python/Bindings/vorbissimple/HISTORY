Python 3 fixes - 17/8/2025

Key Changes

* Ensure the logical stream is initialised, not accidentally initialised
   - This was necessary to avoid a heisenbug triggered by filename length.
* Updated Makefiles
* Make checking the code using the Makefile simpler
* Build the decode buffer better
* Pull in assert header
* Add an assert for the buffers, and also only create buffers of the correct size
* Safely handle situation where number of channels is invalid
* Enable building with santised addresses - requires manual change.
* Create a pathway for building the extension with address santisation
* Fixed the memcpy when copying data in.
* Updated some types to be more precise.
* Created a debugPrint mechanism - commandline toggle-able
* Restructure the guard around memory allocation
* Remove latent aliasing of internal type 'bytes'
* Zero memory for ogg_vorbis_context - which zeroes everything
