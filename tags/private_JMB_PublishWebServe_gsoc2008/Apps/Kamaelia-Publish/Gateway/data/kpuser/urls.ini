#This is the default url list.  The items here are generally in the form:
#[section_name]
#regex:  application regex pattern (will be split by '/')
#import_path:  path to import object from
#app_object:  Attribute name of the WSGI application object in the given module
#
#Please note that this file MUST contain a section error_404 and that section
#MUST NOT contain a regex.  It will be assigned a regex of '.*' automatically
#by the UrlList parser.
#
#Also, please note that order IS important here.  You must put your applications
#in the order you want them evaluated (error_404 will always be handled last no
#matter what).
