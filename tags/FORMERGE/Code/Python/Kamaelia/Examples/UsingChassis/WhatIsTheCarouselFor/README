SimpleMultiFileStreamer.py
     * Simple streamer that repeatedly streams (3 times) the same audio
       file.
     * This is a mainly a demonstration of how to use the
       JoinChooserToCarousel Chassis, and the
       FixedRateControlledReusableFileReader
     * What really happens is a "chooser" takes a playlist of things to
       serve, and the filereader asks the chooser what file it should be
       reading next when it finishes reading a file.

ClientStreamToFile.py
     * Simple client for the above streamer
