<tr><td>
<p>Scalable concurrent systems do not have to be hard - this is a fundamental aim of the Kamaelia project. The real world contains large numbers of items we interact with daily on a concurrent basis, be it every electronic item we own - from kettles to computers through to simple things like roads, office workers and dance partners.</p>
<p>Concurrency in software often takes 3 approaches - process, thread or state machine based. For portability and scalability, state machine based systems are normally the preferred approach. However, even best of breed systems often have a steep learning curve and can hard for beginners to learn, and can be difficult to debug.</p>
<p>Kamaelia represents concurrency as components communicating along unidirectional linkages. Components are python generators embedded into a class augmented by inboxes and outboxes. New components can be written sequentially, and then made concurrent slowly and simply in a controlled fashion.</p>
<p>Building systems is pretty much like using good old fashioned unix pipelines. You choose the components that do the work and string their outputs and inputs together. You can build pipelines or graphs which may also change dynamically. Components also nest simplifying systems. This approach also encourages high levels of reuse.</p>
<p>Using python generators seems to result in performance similar to that of traditional state machines, with an ease of use similar to that of process based concurrency. BBC R&amp;D is building Kamaelia as a testbed for developing open large scale internet media delivery protocols. This paper provides an overview of the core technology allowing others to use the technology for other uses.</p></td></tr>

<p><span style="font-size:17pt;font-weight:600">Kamaelia</span></p>
<p>Kamaelia is a project aimed at exploring long term systems for large scale media delivery. At its core is a concurrency toolkit, focussed mainly on experimenting with network protocols. This toolkit has 2 key portions - Axon and Kamaelia.</p>
<p>Axon itself is the core component infrastructure aimed at making concurrent systems easy to work with. It is written in the python, though a simplistic C++ version also exists. In python terms it implements components using generators, and systems are make by setting up communications between components.</p>
<p>The Kamaelia portion is the larger of the two sections, which is why it is named after the main project - since it is a collection of components that use Axon. These range from components for building network servers and clients through to music playback, audio codec decode through to components suitable for viewing network topologies.</p>
<p>Howver, one key aim of the project is to enable even novices programmers to create scalable, safe concurrent systems quickly and easily.</p>
<p>The Kamaelia project has been released as an open source project licensed under the MPL/GPL/LGPL trilicense. This is the same licensing scheme as dirac and is intended to allow the use of Kamaelia by as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<p>This paper will discuss the current status of the project, the project's motivations, the background to Kamaelia's core concurrency technology, provide a simple example of building systems and components using Axon, and finally finish with some possible options for longer term work, and an invitation to work with us!</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Status</span></p>
<p>The current status of the project is that Axon itself has been deemed feature stable, and currently stands at version 1.0.3. Axon runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Series 60 mobile phones. </p>
<p>As noted above Kamaelia can already be used for a wide variety of tasks from network servers, through to interactive systems, but we feel has a long way to go before the system can be considered reaching a 1.0 release. As a result the current version number reflects this and currently stands at 0.1.2.</p>
<p>That said, like Axon, it runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Series 60 mobile phones, and has also been used to test our ease of use hypothesis on 1 pre-university trainee, with promising results.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Motivations</span></p>
<p>The motivations for the Kamaelia project stem from 3 main points:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>What does the BBC do currently with regard to large scale streaming?</li>
<li>How might demand change in future?</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">What happens if... </span><span style="font-style:italic">(say) the BBC opened the entire archive online and everyone in the UK had broadband?</span></li></ul>
<p>Currently the BBC streams a large amount of content to the UK audience. This currently amounts to several million streams per day to tens of thousands of concurrent viewers. That said, given the 3 points above it is prudent to plan for the day when the BBC may be handling millions of concurrent viewers online.</p>
<p>As a thought experiment, we can also imagine <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">what might happen if </span>(say) 10 years from now, the BBC opened up the entire archive to the entire UK audience online? The creative archive is not that ambitious - after all it is based around what we have the rights to, and the BBC does not currently have those right, but what if legislation happened allowing this? Beyond that copyright does expire eventually, meaning that significant chunks may become available in 10 - 20 years?</p>
<p>Thankfully such a scenario is not a total unknown - there are online stores with thousands upon thousands of items of content, and people's choice tends to follow a well known curve - called a zipf distribution. This is also known as a long tailed distribution due to the shape of the graph that you get if you plot the number of requests for an object (eg 10 million people watching east enders) vs chart position (eg number 10, number 100, number 10000 in the charts).</p>
<p>It turns out that with long tail distributions the bulk of traffic and work is done in this immensely long tail - not in the head. Put another way, the most popular programmes are a fraction of the amount of work you have to do, because given the choice, people tend to choose from the entire range of content available.</p>
<p>ie you can have 20 million homes watching 20 million different things, which is completely different from 20 million people all watching the same thing on TV!</p>
<p>Other issues arise when you scale up to these levels as well. The only open protocol currently in heavy use for streaming is the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP). However, RTP was  originally concieved for internet based Audio/Video conferencing/telephony, which means certain aspects don't scale well for large scale unidirectional streaming.</p>
<p>As a result we needed a platform for designing, implementing and testing new open standards to scale in this way. Unfortunately, scalability and ability to experiment often conflict, which is why we needed to write our own system. Furthermore large scale means highly parallel, and scalable concurrency often has a high barrier to entry. From our perspective this was a real problem since a high barrier to entry can limit the ability to take in new ideas, and limits areas of collaboration. After all those most capable of implementing an idea may not be the same people capable of imagining the idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size:17pt;font-weight:600">Axon's Design Background</span></p>
<p>As previously noted, Axon forms the core concurrency subsystem in Kamaelia, is largely aimed at providing those core concurrency elements. It tries to provide the smallest useful toolset for concurrency needed for Kamaelia components, but no smaller (By comparison it is possible to produce smaller systems, which are useful for exploring various ideas, but tend to be incomplete).</p>
<p>The keys aims in Axon's basic design were as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>It should first and foremost use a scalable approach, which is also portable between operating systems.</li>
<li>It should naturally encourage re-use.</li>
<li>It should be simple. That is it should be sufficiently simple novice programmers can learn the system  and quickly find it easy to use to produce useful systems. This is partly because we want to experiment with new ides and <span style="font-style:italic">novices see possibilities, not problems.</span></li>
<li>It sould provide a <span style="font-style:italic">safe </span>environment for building concurrent systems. Users should not have to worry unduly (or preferably at all) about race hazards, and ideally the user should not have to worry about locks. ie we want a non-locking architecture.</li></ul>
<p>Many of these points will seem contradictory to many used to dealing with scalable concurrent systems - after all even experienced professionals can find scalable concurrency difficult. </p>
<p>Before we discuss the design decisions in Axon we simply note that we believe we have achieved these goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Scaling Concurrency</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-style:italic">&quot;Threads are for people who cant program state machines.&quot; - Alan Cox (http://tinyurl.com/a66es)</span></div></ul>
<p>Let's start at the beginning - methods for scaling concurrent systems in a portable manner. There are essentially 3 well understood and commonly used methods for handling concurrency: processes, threads, and &quot;build your own&quot;.</p>
<p>Processes and threads are very well known approaches to handling concurrency, and indeed are tools built into the operating system allowing it to provide programs with the illusion of sole control of the system. Threads differ from processes in that they reside within a process, and share data within that process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the scalabilty of process and thread based concurrency does not tend to scale equally across different platforms. Furthermore code written using processes and to a lesser extent threads suffers from a key problem from our perspective - the operating system has no way of determining that these processes and threads are working together towards a common goal, rather than competing. Also, under heavy loads context switching can also severely hamper scalability using processes or threads, depending on the operating system or even version of operating system.</p>
<p>As a result the majority of large scale network software, and hence large scale concurrent systems tends to use a &quot;build your own&quot; approach to handling concurrency. In practice, this normally means using state machines.</p>
<p>An interesting question therefore arises - what about the people who can't program state machines? This is a serious question - we are targeting as wide a group of people as possible and aiming to include novices within that group.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">State Machines</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-style:italic">A state machine is a piece of sequential processing that can release control half way and be restarted retaining state</span></li></ul>
<p>What really is the problem with state machines? Unfortunately, they are hard to get right 100% right even when you're pretty certain you are doing the right thing, and this fact is especially true for novices. Also we want to allow people to be able to pick up other people's code and reuse it. This increases the likelihood that someone maintaining code will not be the original author, and unfortunately debugging someone else's state machine is  at least twice as hard as designing the state machine in the first place.</p>
<p>In practice there are a variety of frameworks that exist that try to make creating systems like this alot simpler. In python the twisted framwork is probably the best of breed framework for dealing with single threaded scalable concurrency, and often betrays this state machine heritage. However despite being a very good framework provide lots of high quality assistance it still has a barrier to entry that is very high for the novice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Scalability or ease?</span></p>
<p>At this point we begin to wonder - if we want ease we would normally choose process based approaches and for scalability we would choose state machine approaches. Do we really have to choose between these two, or is there an alternative?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-style:italic">A </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">state machine</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is a piece of sequential processing that can release control half way and be restarted retaining state</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic">A </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">generator</span><span style="font-style:italic"> is a piece of sequential processing that can release control half way and be restarted retaining state</span></li></ul>
<p>A generator however also looks single threaded - much like process based code - so is this what we want? It's worth noting that Twisted itself also recognises that generators might be useful, providing the twisted.flow module.</p>
<p>The key different between twisted.flow and Axon lies in the way we compose systems. Our hypothesis is that it is this approach for composition that limits the complexity that the programmer has to deal with rather than increasing.</p>
<p>By using generators, we can allow novices to write small pieces of code completely single threaded to test their ideas. After this they can then modify their code to work in a parallel manner by simply adding a few yield statements in the right places, and changing their interaction with other systems and users. This transition from single threaded to working cleanly with the concurrency toolkit is something that can be done slowly and incrementally, often without radical code restructuring.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Opportunity for collaboration with Twisted?</span></p>
<p>Whilst we developed Axon independently of the Twisted codebase, this was a deliberate decision - we wanted to explore a variety of ideas, and the use of generators was made late in the design process. It is entirely likely that Axon would be a good fit to integrate with Twisted - largely because both systems are single threaded, and Axon does not require control of any main event loop - it simply requires CPU time periodically.</p>
<p>Furthermore Twisted is a stable, mature system and suitable for production systems, whereas at present Kamaelia is not mature, and as a result not suitable for use in production systems. Kamaelia is however highly suitable now for experimentation even by novices, and bringing this alternative approach into Twisted might be beneficial to both projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Concurrency is Easy?</span></p>
<p>Creating code that can run concurrently is one thing. Actually making systems that are concurrent, naturally concurrent and easy to use is not considered common. Indeed, concurrency is often considered hard to work with. </p>
<p>However, there is one field of IT and computing that uses simple, easy to use concurrency day in day out and does so on a regular basis - unix systems administration. Many unix systems admins would find the following small script simple to understand and very similar to the sort of shell script they write on a regular basis:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier">find -type f . |</span></li>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier">egrep -v '/build/^./MANIFEST' | </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier">while read i; do </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier">   cp ../Source/$i $i;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier">done</span></div></ul>
<li type="disc">Nominally this can be argued to have 4 processing units, with 3 concurrent units, one of which consists of 2 serialised processing units. The find statement runs in concurrently to the egrep statement which runs in parallel to the while statement. The while statement itself is controlled by the read statement, and dependent on the value controls execution of the cp statement.</li>
<p>This is a relatively complex parallel computing task that many systems admins would find natural to write and would naturally take good advantage of a 3 core/CPU system. However whilst many systems admins would not consider themselves the world's best parallel systems programmers, it is probably true that they are the world's most common parallel programmers and highly proficient at it.</p>
<p>Axon models itself on hardware systems that follow a very similar model to Unix pipelines. What are the key characteristics of a unix pipelines then?</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>They're essentially concurrent sequential processes - both in practice, and also in the manner of the classic paper on the topic (CSP). One major limitation of unix pipelines is that they are essentially linear - largely only allowing data flow in one direction inside the pipeline.</li>
<li>Items have no concept of what might be next in the pipeline - if they are even inside a pipeline.</li>
<li>Items in the pipeline simply communicate with 3 local file handles : stdin, stdout, stderr.</li></ul>
<p>These 3 points are often considered sufficient for any CSP style system, however there are a couple of further details which are worth noting:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>How data passes between processes. In Unix pipelines processes can send data to the pipeline whenever they want, and will simply block when the hidden intermediate buffers between processes are full. This allows to operating system to handle race hazards between processes. (Consider a program that produces data faster than another that consumes and uses that data)</li>
<li>The system environment. This allows processes to place information in a standard place for notification of standard resources. The most commonly used standard resource for example is where to find other commands - specifically the PATH variable in the standard environment. At it's most basic though the system environment forms a basic key/value lookup tool.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size:17pt;font-weight:600">Axon</span></p>
<p>Having discussed the background to the key decisions made during Axon's design we now discuss the key features of Axon, what they do and how to use them. The key classes in Axon are as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-weight:600">Component</span>. A component is a self pausing sequential objects - typically a generator - that sends data to local interfaces</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">Linkage</span>. A linkage is a facility for joining interfaces, allowing system composition</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">Scheduler</span>. The scheduler is a mechanism for giving components CPU time. The current scheduler is relatively primitive, however schedulers may also schedule other schedulers however allowing more complex priority mechanisms to be built if desired.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">Postman</span>. The postmas is a facility for tracking linkages, and handling data transferral. It is expected that the postman will decrease in importance with time and end up simply tracking linkages.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">Co-ordinating Assistant/Tracker</span> (cat). The co-ordinating assistant tracker provides environmental facilities for the same reasons as the unix environment. In practical terms this is similar to a Linda tuple space, and could evolve towards that sort of general facility.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Axon: Component</span></p>
<p>A component in axon is a class that has a generator method called &quot;main&quot;. The fact that this generator is a method means that the generator has access to a local object state. Furthermore, this local object state is accessible by code that manipulates the object, forming a mechanism for comunicating with the generator.</p>
<p>Axon provides a standardised mechanism for communicating with the generator meaning that components do not need to share data, other than to hand off ownership of data between themselves. (Much like unix processes do not share data, but can hand off data between processes by sending data to stdout/stderr)</p>
<p>Specifically, component classes are augmented by a list of named inboxes and a list of named outboxes. Both inboxes and outboxes form queues for sending data to/from a component, and a component only communicates with inboxes and outboxes.</p>
<p>The exception to this is components that communicate with the outside world in some manner - such as read from files, network sockets, displaying information. Such components are often named adaptors by convention to simplify identifying such components since testing these can be more complex.</p>
<p>The default set of inboxes are named &quot;inbox&quot; and &quot;control&quot;. &quot;inbox&quot; is expected to recieve bulk data - much like stdin for processes. &quot;control&quot; is expected to recieve signalling information which may control the component. An example message that may be recieved on a control inbox is &quot;producerFinished&quot;. This allows the component to know that the component sending data on the inbox has finished. (eg end of file)</p>
<p>The default set of outboxes are named &quot;outbox&quot; and &quot;signal&quot;. &quot;outbox&quot; is expected to be sent bulk data - much like stdout for processes. &quot;signal&quot; is expected to be sent signalling information that may or may not control another component. A file reader for example may read data from a file and send the data to its &quot;outbox&quot;, and wen it reaches the end of file may send a &quot;producerFinished&quot; message to &quot;signal&quot;.</p>
<p>The simplest example component that is useful is probably as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>class Echo(component):</li>
<ul type="disc"><div>def main(self):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>if self.dataReady(&quot;inbox&quot;):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>data = self.recv(&quot;inbox&quot;)</div>
<div>self.send(data, &quot;outbox&quot;)</div></ul>
<div>yield 1</div></ul></ul></ul>
<p>The logic of this component should be clear - when data is ready in the inbox &quot;inbox&quot;, the component takes that data from that inbox, and sends it to its outbox &quot;outbox&quot;. </p>
<p>Whilst this may seem like a simple &quot;pass through&quot; (which is is) component with no clear benefit, it forms an extremely useful tool. Since it is a component, we can also use it as a basic network protocol - one that echoes back to the client what they send, extremely useful when testing systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Axon: Scheduler</span></p>
<p>The scheduler provides components with the CPU periodically. Essentially its general process of operation is as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Holds a run queue containing activated components</li>
<li>Calls the generator for each component sequentially, which may yield a variety of possible values for communication to the scheduler</li></ul>
<p>There are essentially 3 different return values that hold meaning at present.</p>
<p>Continue Running</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>If the value yielded by a component's generator is true then the component is deemed to still be active, but to have relinquished control for some reason. (For example it may be waiting for information from other components, a network socket or the user)</li></ul>
<p>Component Activation</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>If the value yielded is a newComponent object, the components contained within that object are activated (essentially their main() method is called, and the resulting generator stored in the run queue).</li></ul>
<p>Component Deactivation</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>If the value yielded is false, the component is removed from the run queue</li>
<li>If the component allows an exception to emerge from the generator for whatever reason it is also deemed to have exited.</li></ul>
<li type="disc"><span style="font-weight:600">Scheduler: Scheduling policy</span></li>
<p>The scheduler in Axon is in practice currently a very primitive linear/roundrobin scheduler. If the scheduler has 10 things to run, currently it runs them all one after another repeatedly with no change in order. This particular policy is not however guaranteed to stay the same but was chosen for simplicity and fairness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Axon: Linkages</span></p>
<p>Given the components may run in parallel we need a mechanism for enabling connections between components. Linkages form this mechanism, and unlike components and the scheduler are traditional passive objects.</p>
<p>Linkages normally join outboxes to inboxes between components. However when dealing with connections to sub-/nested/child components outbox-outbox and inbox-inbox connections make sense. In the case where there is a link between a component and a nested component the parent components inbox (or outbox) associated with the name of that box is prefixed by an underscore by convention to indicate an internal linkage.</p>
<p>Linkages can currently only be created inside a component. Therefore in order to create a pipeline of 5 components, that pipeline must itself be a component.</p>
<p>Linkages are therefore our mechanism for forming composition of components, and this approach or components not knowing who they are linked to tends to encourage reuse of components. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Linkage: Example</span></p>
<p>Take for example the following simple streaming client:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>class SimpleStreamingClient(component):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>def main(self):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>client = TCPClient(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, 1500)</div>
<div>decoder = VorbisDecode()</div>
<div>player = AOAudioPlaybackAdaptor()</div>
<div>self.link((client, &quot;outbox&quot;), (decoder, &quot;inbox&quot;))</div>
<div>self.link((decoder, &quot;outbox&quot;), (player, &quot;inbox&quot;))</div>
<div></div>
<div>self.addChildren(decoder, player, client)</div>
<div>yield newComponent(decoder, player, client)</div>
<div>while 1:</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>self.pause()</div>
<div>yield 1</div></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p></p>
<p>Since it is contructed from a number of components, it too must be a component. The component creates 3 components - one for connecting to the server, one for decoding and one for playback. These are then linked together, and activated by yielding them back to the scheduler. After that, the only purpose of this component is to acts as a shell. As a result, it returns control to the scheduler and hints (<span style="font-family:Courier">self.pause()</span>) that it no longer needs any CPU time.</p>
<p>Similarly a server capable of serving an adhoc file to this simple client might look like this:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>def AdHocFileProtocolHandler(filename):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>class klass(Kamaelia.ReadFileAdaptor.ReadFileAdaptor):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>def __init__(self, *argv, **argd):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>super(klass, self).__init__(filename, readmode=&quot;bitrate&quot;, bitrate=400000)</div></ul></ul>
<div>return klass</div></ul></ul>
<p></p>
<ul type="disc"><div>class SimpleStreamingServer(component):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>def main(self):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>server = SimpleServer(protocol=AdHocFileProtocolHandler(&quot;foo.ogg&quot;),</div>
<div>                      port=clientServerTestPort)</div>
<div>self.addChildren(server)</div>
<div>yield _Axon.Ipc.newComponent(server)</div>
<div>while 1:</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>self.pause()</div>
<div>yield 1</div></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<p></p>
<p>What this example does is to use the generic simple server component for the bulk of the network handling. When a client connects however the server needs to be able to create components for handling the connection. Specifically these components handle the actual protocol for speaking to the client over the network connection. As a result the protocol argument takes a class reference to allow protocol objects to be created.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the protocol class is created dynamically and will always create a component that reads the file foo.ogg, and sends it at a constant bit rate to it's outbox. </p>
<p>What this means is in practice when a client connects to the port the server is listening on, the specified protocol component will be created and recieve network data on it's inbox and any data it sends to it's outbox will be sent to the client. This enables a wide range of behaviours to take place and to be tested in complete isolation from the network.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Linkage Example: Re-use</span></p>
<p>Suppose however that rather than connecting to a TCP based server, we wanted to modify out simple streaming component to connect to a multicast session instead, decode and play that back. The following code snippet shows in bold the required changes to the program:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>class SimpleStreamingClient(component):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>def main(self):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-weight:600">client = Multicast_transceiver(&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 1600, &quot;224.168.2.9&quot;, 0)</span></div>
<div><span style="font-weight:600">adapt = detuple(1)</span></div>
<div>decoder = VorbisDecode()</div>
<div>player = AOAudioPlaybackAdaptor()</div>
<div>self.link((client, &quot;outbox&quot;), (<span style="font-weight:600">adapt</span>, &quot;inbox&quot;))</div>
<div>self.link((<span style="font-weight:600">adapt</span>, &quot;outbox&quot;), (decoder, &quot;inbox&quot;))</div>
<div>self.link((decoder, &quot;outbox&quot;), (player, &quot;inbox&quot;))</div>
<div></div>
<div>self.addChildren(decoder, <span style="font-weight:600">adapt, </span>player, client)</div>
<div>yield newComponent(decoder, <span style="font-weight:600">adapt, </span>player, client)</div>
<div>while 1:</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>self.pause()</div></ul>
<div>yield 1</div></ul></ul></ul>
<p>Essentially we have simply done the following:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Instead of creating a TCPClient, we have created a Multicast_transceiver component</li>
<li>The multicast_transceiver component sends tuples of (sender, data) to its output. This is largely because data recieved over a multicast socket is a UDP socket which isn't connected.</li>
<li>In order to extract the data from this tuple as part of the decode chain we simply chain the data from the Multicast_transceiver into a detuple component.</li>
<li>The rest of the decode chain then remains the same</li></ul>
<p>As a result, not only have we been able to largely reuse the bulk of the streaming server client, but also we have used the decoding and playback components unchanged. </p>
<p></p>
<li type="disc"><span style="font-weight:600">Co-ordinating Assistant Tracker</span></li>
<p>Finally we have the co-ordinating assistant tracker. Essentially this tracks two distinct types of values in an Axon system: values and services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Values</span></p>
<p>The cat tracks values associated with keys. This provides facilities <span style="font-style:italic">similar</span> to environment variables (or a linda tuple space) and is intended to facilitate the collection of stats in network servers. At present not many components make use of this facility, but experience with similar systems imply that this is needed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Services</span></p>
<li type="disc">A service is a name given to a <span style="font-family:Courier">(component, inbox)</span> tuple. This allows a component to advertise a service upon which it may expect values to be sent. This facility is deliberately modelled on the concept of named ports in AmigaOS and can be viewed as similar to services in a rendevous/zero conf environment. </li>
<p>Components can contact request access to a service via the CAT by name and then make use of the service. If the component requires communication back to itself from the service, it can send the service a service.</p>
<p>Whilst sounding hideously recursive and theoretical, services were borne out of a very specific realworld usecase:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Suppose we have 2 server components in a system.</li>
<li>Both of these will have a number of active sockets, which are traditionally managed via a select call. In Axon this maps directory to a selector component that simply tracks sockets and sends components managing those sockets &quot;data ready&quot; messages in order activate them.</li>
<li>Clearly if we have 2 (or more) servers in a system they could all share the same selector component.</li>
<li>At this point in time we have the problem about how we will find this single selector component. We <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> enforce this on users of the selector component using a singleton pattern, but we want components to be generic. The alternative is to allow a selector to register somewhere that it exists and that it is willing to handle arbitrary </li>
<li>connections.</li></ul>
<p>Services provide a way of allow components to share active functionality:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>As a server starts up, it can then check for the existance of a selector service. Since none exists, it creates a selector component. That selector component registers itself as a service with the CAT.</li>
<li>The next server that starts up can also check for the existance of a selector. This server finds a selector service. It can then send that service a message stating &quot;wake me up on this inbox if you find a this socket&quot;. It does this, effectively, by sending a reference to the socket, itself and the inbox name to the selector. (This is why we talk about sending a service to a service)</li></ul>
<p>It's worth noting that the only one of these two components needs to know how to create a selector component. It is possible that as time progresses that this aspect of services may expand.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size:17pt;font-weight:600">Component Creation Howto</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>In this section we shall describe how to create a basic component that deals with one of the most common network formats, and translates this from textual form to a python dictionary.</p>
<p>MIME/RFC2822 type objects are common in network protocols, used in email, web, usenet systems and several others. </p>
<ul type="disc"><div>From: michaels@rd.bbc.co.uk</div>
<div>Subject: MimeDictComponent</div>
<div></div>
<div>And so we see a sample mime dict...</div></ul>
<p>Essentially this forms a collection of serialised key/value pairs. In python the closest natural structure that is key/value based is the &quot;dict&quot; type. This leads us to the idea that if we had a MIME Dict component we could place this between network connections handling components and other components.</p>
<p>This &quot;MIME Dict&quot; component should:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Accept dict like objects, but translates them to MIME-like messages</li>
<li>Accept MIME-like messages and converts them to dicts.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">MimeDictComponent</span></p>
<p>The MimeDictComponent is a real component in Kamaelia, and we're largly going to discuss how it was written, rather than laboriously go through code (The code is always available in CVS and releases).</p>
<p>The basic approach was as follows. The core functionality was written first. That is we first created a component that subclassed dict. The __str__ method was replaced with a custom implementation that returned an RFC2822/MIME style message. After that was written, a staticmethod &quot;fromString&quot; was added to the MimeDict class that could accept an RFC2822/MIME style message. </p>
<p>A further key point is that all this code was written entirely test first, with no special considerations.</p>
<p>Only after the basic class was able to perform the desired transformation did we consider the specific interface that the component may need. It's worth noting that should this interface have required changes to the MimeDict class these would have been added as tests to the test suite for MimeDict first and implemented independently of the component system.</p>
<p>When designing the MimeDictComponent we needed to decide what interface we desired from the system. Specifically this relate to the inboxes and outboxes on the component, and what data we expect to send/receive to/from the component. We decided upon the following interface:</p>
<ul type="disc"><ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-weight:600">control</span> - on which we may recieve a shutdown message</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">signal</span> - one which we will send shutdown messages</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">demarshall</span> - an inbox to which you send strings for turning into dicts</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">demarshalled</span> - an outbox which spits out parsed strings as dicts</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">marshall</span> - an inbox to which you send objects for turning into strings</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">marshalled</span> - an outbox which spits out translated dicts as strings</li></ul></ul>
<p>The irony here though is that it turned out to be simpler to create a generic marshalling component instead. During creation we pass over a reference to the MimeDict. Then the generic marshalling code would use the facilities of the MimeDict class to perform the actual transformations detailed above.</p>
<p>For example, the main loop of the component ended up looking like this:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>while 1:</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>self.pause()</div>
<div>if self.dataReady(&quot;control&quot;):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>data = self.recv(&quot;control&quot;)</div>
<div>if isinstance(data, Axon.Ipc.producerFinished):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>self.send(Axon.Ipc.producerFinished(), &quot;signal&quot;)</div>
<div>return</div></ul>
<div>if self.dataReady(&quot;marshall&quot;):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>data = self.recv(&quot;marshall&quot;)</div>
<div>self.send(str(data),&quot;marshalled&quot;)</div></ul>
<div>if self.dataReady(&quot;demarshall&quot;):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>data = self.recv(&quot;demarshall&quot;)</div>
<div>self.send(self.klass.fromString(data), &quot;demarshalled&quot;)</div></ul>
<div>yield 1</div></ul></ul></ul>
<p></p>
<p>For the specific marshaller that we wanted we could then take a traditional subclassing style of approch:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>class MimeDictMarshaller(MarshallComponent):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>def __init__(self, *argv, **argd):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>super(MimeDictMarshaller, self).__init__(MimeDict, *argv, **argd)</div></ul></ul></ul>
<p></p>
<p>Or we could choose a class decoration approach:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>def MarshallerFactory(klass):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>class newclass(MarshalComponent):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>def __init__(self, *argv, **argd):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>super(newclass, self).__init__(klass, *argv, **argd)</div></ul></ul>
<div>return newclass</div>
<div></div></ul>
<div>MimeDictMarshaller = MarshallerFactory(MimeDict)</div></ul>
<p>It is interesting to note that this approach encouraged naturally the creation of a generic component that allows for greater use of non-component based code in the component framework.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Summary: New Components</span></p>
<p>This has been a relatively high level brief overview of how to go about designing and implementing a component. There is a longer tutorial on the Kamaelia website revolving around creating a multicast transceiver. Again, that code was designed and written using much the same approach:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Don't worry about concurrency, write single threaded</li>
<li>When the code works, then convert to components</li>
<li>Change control methods into inboxes/outboxes</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size:17pt;font-weight:600">Ease of use Hypothesis</span></p>
<p>As noted we have hypothesised that using simple components communicating to/from local inboxes/outboxes composed into systems may be simpler to work with when building concurrent systems than traditional approaches.</p>
<p>We were recently able to test this hypothesis on a pre-university trainee, who was happy to let me describe him as a novice programmer. We'll call him &quot;C&quot; for the rest of this document. Prior to joining our group &quot;C&quot; had done A-Level computer studies. This involved a small amount of Visual Basic programming and creating a small Access database.</p>
<p>This trainee had a 3 month placement within our group which involved the following:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Started off learning python &amp; axon (2 weeks)</li>
<li>Created a &quot;learning system&quot; based around parsing a Shakespeare play:</li>
<ul type="disc"><li>Performs filtering, character identification, demultiplexing, etc</li>
<li>Used pygame for display, stopped short of using pyTTS...</li></ul>
<li>As well as working on his main project</li></ul>
<p>The project we set &quot;C&quot; was something you would not normally give to a novice programmer with &quot;C&quot;'s background.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We asked him to created a simplistic low bandwidth video streamer, based on a scalable architecture. The server would have an MPEG video, and take a frame as JPEG every n seconds. This is sent to the client over a framing protocol Ciaran designed and implemented. The client then displays the images as they arrive. The client systems &quot;C&quot; would be required to implement would be both PC based for testing, with the primary target platform being series 60 mobiles.</p>
<p>The idea is this simulates previewing PVR content on a mobile.</p>
<p>The project was successful, &quot;C&quot; achieved the goals, and wrote components satisfying every part of that of the description. For network handling &quot;C&quot; was able to use the  &quot;SimpleServer&quot; and simple &quot;TCPclient&quot; components. It is also interesting to note that rather than finding this a frustrating experience (given his background) that he found the experience fun.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to retry this experiment, both with Axon/Kamaelia and other frameworks for clients and servers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">CSP vs State Machines</span></p>
<p>From a performance perspective the question arises: is a CSP based approach - such as that taken by Axon - better or worse than a state machine style system? At present we would suggest that neither is better or worse than the other - at least theoretically.</p>
<p>After all, state machine systems often have intermediate buffers (even single variables) for handoff between states and state machines. In many respects this is akin to outboxes and inboxes. If they are collapsed into one, as planned, this is probably as efficient as traditional frameworks.</p>
<p>We have now performed some preliminary tests using a simpified version of the component system and it does tend to imply that collapsing outbox/inbox pairs into one is effectively as efficient as the non-componentised system. The difference of course is that the componentised system is easy to reuse.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Integration with other systems</span></p>
<p>Kamaelia does not exist in a void. Having the ability to assimilate code and functionality from other systems easily and quickly is something needed by Kamaelia. Given that python generators do not exist in other languages we need a default mechanism for interacting with traditional procedural languages.</p>
<p>By providing this we provide a mechanism for components to be written in languages other than python providing an incremental optimisation step where needed. </p>
<p>The mechanism we provide is a default main generator which unless overridden by a subclass calls 3 default callback:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>initialiseComponent()</li>
<li>mainBody()</li>
<li>closeDownComponent()</li></ul>
<p>The reason for just these 3 callbacks is because every program that exists essentially matches the following underlying structure:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>perform some initialisation</div>
<div>loop until some condition is true:</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>perform the bulk of the work of the program (normally)</div></ul>
<div>perform shutdown code</div></ul>
<p>Sometimes different parts of this template program may be empty. For example crash based systems are designed never to shutdown  - only to recover from crashes, and the simple &quot;hello world&quot; program generally has an empty loop and no shutdown. Nevertheless many programs can be brought down to these 3 phases of a program.</p>
<p>This logic, is mananged by the default <span style="font-family:Courier">main </span>generator, which looks like this:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>def main(self):</li>
<ul type="disc"><div>result = self.initialiseComponent()</div>
<div>if not result: result = 1</div>
<div>yield result</div>
<div>while(result):</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>result = self.mainBody()</div>
<div>if result:</div>
<ul type="disc"><div>yield result</div></ul></ul>
<div>yield self.closeDownComponent()</div></ul></ul>
<p>You'll note that any returned value from a callback is yielded back to the scheduler allowing components using the callback form to start new components as required.</p>
<p>The secondary advantage of also having this callback mechanism in addition to the generator approach is that some programmers simply find a callback approach easier to work with. As a result having this call back approach as well as the generator approach is extremely useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size:17pt;font-weight:600">Futures</span></p>
<p>Currently the version number of Kamaelia, whilst stable and useful stands at 0.1.2. We there see a lot of enhancements to come to both Axon and Kamaelia before we reach a 1.0 release which we consider feature stable and sufficiently complete. This section details a few of the areas which we may extend Kamaelia and Axon into given sufficient interest and resources.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Axon for C++</span></p>
<p>We do not wish the approach and benefits we have found in Axon/Kamaelia to simply limited to those using the python language. As a result, when adding features we have often considered &quot;how could this be implemented in other languages&quot;. With regard to python's generators, one can use Duff's device to implement generator like functionality in C++.</p>
<p>As a proof of concept, we have produced a simple and naive translation of a &quot;mini-axon&quot; system into C++. This is complete using generators. A simple producer component using this C++ version of mini-axon looks like this:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>struct Producer : public SimpleComponent {<br /><br />    mystring msg;<br />    Producer()  {     };<br />    ~Producer() {     };<br /><br />    virtual int next() {<br />    GENERATOR_CODE_START<br />        while(1) {<br />           msg.payload = &quot;hello world!&quot;;<br />           send(&amp;msg);<br />           YIELD(1);<br />        };<br />    GENERATOR_CODE_END<br />    };<br />};</div></ul>
<p></p>
<p>One interesting target system for a C++ based system using Axon would be IBM's CELL processor, which is most notably known for powering Sony's PS3. We currently hypothsis that Axon's dataflow architecture would be a very good match for the dataflow architecture inside the CELL CPU.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Axon Optimisations, Updates</span></p>
<p>Axon as it currently stands focusses on correctness and safety over speed. One example of this is that linkages are currently registered with a Postman who then manages deliveries from outboxes to inboxes. This process involves copying of data from outboxes to inboxes. </p>
<p>One optimisation that can be made here for example is to collapse inboxes into outboxes. Some initial tests with a model implementation of a subset of Axon suggest that this does indeed bring performance benefits, and is a worthwhile optimisation. When the issues in collapsing inboxes into outboxes are sufficiently well understoof they will be merged into Axon.</p>
<p>Similarly, at present some parts of Axon's API, and creation of pipelines can be clunky, and so we are examining how to make this clearer and easier to read. </p>
<p></p>
<li type="disc"><span style="font-weight:600">Automated Component Distribution over Clusters</span></li>
<p>Since components in Axon only communicate with other components over local interfaces, they have no way of knowing whether the component they're communicating with is on the same machine or not. Indeed this very fact makes the creation and testing of protocols fairly simple - you simply test the client protocol handler and server protocol handlers by joining their in/out-boxes together. When that works you simply place the client &amp; server protocol handlers in generic client and server code on different machines.</p>
<p>This opens up the possibility of running entire axon systems over clusters of machines transparently - Axon is designed of course to work well with a single CPU system, but could be used to scale over clusters. One method that would be needed here is opaque component creation, and one method that may be of use here is to extend the services model of the co-ordinating assistant tracker.</p>
<p>Automated component distribution over clusters would also assist in naturally taking advantage of systems like the CELL CPU.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Kamaelia Component Repository</span></p>
<p>A component system is only as useful as the components available in that system. As a result the main focus of Kamaelia at present is on creating new components useful in specific real world systems that BBC R&amp;D needs. However a standard repository (but perhaps not centralised) for components such that people can find new components quickly and easily to solve their task would magnify the value of Kamaelia/Axon significantly.</p>
<p>At present the Kamaelia project itself is a component repository, but we would be extremely interested in proposals that encourage sharing and reuses between groups.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">More Concurrency Tools</span></p>
<p>The current releases of Kamaelia only include support for components written as either generators or using the callback mechanism. In CVS we have support for components written to use threading instead of generators, and these are focussed around dealing with objects that can only be used in a blocking manner. (The impetus for this was due to the socket module in the Nokia Series 60 implementation of python not supporting non-blocking sockets)</p>
<p>Other concurrency tools we'd be interested in seeing back components for would be:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Operating system level processes</li>
<li>Greenlets - essentially an implementation of coroutines for python</li>
<li>Twisted objects. (We see no reason why Axon/Kamaelia should compete with alternative frameworks and favour collaboration/co-operation)</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Extensions to Kamaelia: More protocols, experimental servers</span></p>
<p>Since we're working on scaling delivery of BBC content, and believe there to be issues with some of the existing open protocols for streaming the best way to demonstrate this is to implement these protocols and show what happens.</p>
<p>Initially we are implementing RTSP/RTP for streaming Ogg Vorbis, and after that will work on other protocols. As well as this we need to build support for experimentation with different protocols for peer to peer and collaborative client hub systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Finally, Collaboration</span></p>
<p>If you're interested in working with us, please do: join the mailing list, download, the code, play with it and if you wnat to write docs, code, components, or constructive feedback, please do. If you want to explore some of the more &quot;future&quot; oriented ideas rather than work on the stablising the code base, you're more than welcome.</p>
<p>If you find the code looks vaguely interesting, please use and give us feedback. We're very open to exploring changes to the system and willing to give people CVS commit access in order to try their ideas, within some fair and free bounds.</p>
<p>Anyone working with alternative frameworks for single threaded concurrency is <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> welcome to come and criticise and suggested new ideas. If you would like to integrate our system with yours that would be extremely interesting.</p>
