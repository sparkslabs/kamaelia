Microprocess - A class supporting parallel execution.

A microprocess is a class supporting parallel execution, provided by
forming a wrapper around a generator. It also provides a place for context
to be stored about the generator. In terms of runtime a microprocess can
be viewed to have 2 different life cycles - that which an external user
sees, and that which the microprocess sees.

In terms of runtime life cycle viewed externally, a microprocess is created,
activated, and then has its next method repeatedly called until a false
value is returned, at which point the microprocess is deleted. In terms
of a more traditional approach the next call approximates to a timeslice
being allocated to a process/thread.

The runtime life cycle from the view of the microprocess stems from the
fact that a generator wraps a thread of control, by effectively treating
the program counter like a static variable. The following describes this
runtime from the microprocess's point of view.

First the '__init__' function is called during initialisation at object
creation time. This results in a non-active, non-running microprocess.
Activation has been deliberately separated from creation and initialisation.
At some point in the future, the microprocess's activate method is called,
activating the object. When the object is activated, an  internal call
to a '_microprocessGenerator' occurs. This function in fact results in
the return object being a generator, which can then have its next method
called repeatedly. This generator is  then stored as an attribute of the
microprocess class.

The following describe the flow of control the generator takes when the
generator is provided with a flow of control/time slice via it's next
method. Initially, it creates a local generator object - 'pc' - by calling
the object's main method. (This allows the client of the microprocess class
to provide their own generator if they wish.) This is necessary due to
the fact that any function containing a 'yield' keyword is a  generator -
the 'yield' keyword cannot be abstracted away. Next, inside a loop, the
microprocess checks to see if it is runnable. If the microprocess is
runnable, the local generator object 'pc' has it's next method called -
effectively providing a time slice to the user of the microprocess class.
Any result provided by the timeslice is then yielded (returned) to the
client of the generator. After this, if the microprocess has its stopped
flag set, the microprocess generator simply yields a null value, followed
by stopping.

This all boils down to checking to see if the microprocess is not stopped
and runnable prior to running the body of a generator formed from the
main method of the class. The intent here is that users will inherit from
the microprocess class, and then reimplement the main method, which
periodically yields control. If the user/inheriting class does not implement
a main method, then the system provides a stub that simply returns.

Essentially the microprocess provides a context for scheduling generators,
and treating them similar to processes/threads.

Clients are not expected to use the microprocess class itself directly -
they are expected to subclass the microprocess class. Subclasses do need
however to call the microprocess constructor. A minimal client class could
look like this::

from microprocess import microprocess
class automaton(microprocess):
   def __init__(self):
      self.Microprocess() # Call superclass constructor
   def main:
      while 1:
      yield 1
      print "Hello Again"

This microprocess would then be run by a wrapper as follows::

   import microprocess, scheduler
   s = scheduler.scheduler()
   a = automaton()
   a.activate()
   s._addThread(a)
   s.runThreads()

The component class does this, and adds further facilities for
inter-microprocess communication. Likewise, the postman class subclasses
microprocess so that it can be scheduled in parallel with other tasks.

As noted previously, every microprocess object has access to a debugger,
which is accessed via the local attribute self.debugger, which we shall
return to later. Likewise every microprocess object contains a reference
to a scheduler.

# Microprocess - provides a framework for clients to inherit
# to be able to participate in a co-operative concurrency
# environment
#
# Specifically, classes that subclass microprocess, and implement
# either a main() generator function can be activated, and
# scheduled by the scheduler/microthread systems. Essentially a
# microprocess provides a minimal runtime context for the
# scheduling & thread handling system.
# 
# An example minimal microprocess is::
# 
#   class bibble(microprocess):
#      def __init__(self, num):
#         self.num = num
#         self.Microprocess()
#      def main():
#         yield 1
#         while 1:
#            print "we loop forever", num
#            yield 1
# 
# Which can have (say) 4 instantiations activated by the following::
#
#    bibble(1).activate()
#    bibble(2).activate()
#    bibble(3).activate()
#    bibble(4).activate()
# 
# If the scheduler isn't running, it'd need running too::
# 
#    scheduler.run.runThreads()
#
# Again, most of this is hidden from you if you are implementing a
# component.
# 
# All methods though are available to components, and hence it's worth
# noting the pause & stop methods, and their purpose/usage.
#
# Attributes of a Microprocess:
#
#    - **init** - A flag to indicate if the microprocess has been correctly
#      initialised or not. This allows the system to check that a client
#      class has in fact called the parent constructor classes as required
#      or not.
#
#    - **id** - a unique numerical id - this is akin to a standard process
#      id.
#
#    - **runnable** - This indicates if the code is runnable or not. The
#      idea here is to support processes that pause until data becomes
#      available, are unpaused in some manner, and then continue.
#
#    - **stopped** - This indicates that the code is being shutdown. If
#      code is stopped, it is essentially removed from the run queue,
#      and given no further time slices.
#
#    - **name** - The name of the microprocess - this is generally used
#      in debugging.
#
#    - **thread** - This is the generator object created by calling the
#      object's main method. Repeatedly calling self.thread.next() provides
#      the generator function in the generator object more time slices.
#
#    - **scheduler** - This is the scheduler to be used for scheduling
#      child processes of the object.
#
#    - **debugger** - A local debugging object. (See the debug class
#      docs for more detail)
