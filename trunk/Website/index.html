<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-style:italic">Kamaelia is designed as a testbed for network experimentation using a component architecture designed to simplify creation and testing of new protocols for large scale media delivery systems.</span></div>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">But what is it?</span></p>
<p>A way of treating software like toy building blocks (pick your favourite construction toy!), by using generators to represent blocks (components) and out lists (outboxes and inboxes) as links between them. The current focus of the system is on building network servers and network server systems, however it can equally easily be used for GUI based interactive systems.</p>
<p>The basic system is written in python using generators. Generators can be thought of as resumable functions. The approach for building components and systems is similar to using Unix command line pipes, CSP and hardware. Specifically you write small focussed components which only know about their local inputs and outputs. Interesting systems are then composed using linkages, creating networks of components linking outboxes to inboxes, in a similar way that unix pipelines create interesting systems by linking stdout to stdin between successive programs. </p>
<p>This differs from many other systems like in that it doesn't use essentially a state machine based approach, rather relying on the python language to provide the basic concurrency requirements. This approach is however somewhat experimental, and at this stage not as efficient, however this will change. If you are looking to build a production system Kamaelia is probably not appropriate at present.</p>
<p>Take a TCP server as an example. You have a generic TCP server component that accepts a protocol component. That server component handles then everything except the actual protocol. The work in creating (and hence testing and experimenting) is then limited to just writing your protocol. You don't have to consider basic network server scaling issues, you don't need to restructure your protocol to fit a framework (thereby making it more difficult to experiment with the protocol), you just write the protocol. You can also test the protocol in isolation from the network making protocol testing and compliance testing significantly simpler.</p>
<p>ie the key difference from traditional software systems is that people are able to write new components and network protocols for the system using simple techniques to integrate with a larger testbed framework. The approach is inspired directly from the techniques used for asynchronous hardware construction. More documentation will be added as we do on, but for now there is documentation in the CVS tree. (See download below)</p>
<p><a href="KamaeliaStatus.html"><span style="font-weight:600">What Stage Is The Project At ?</span></a></p>
<p>The bulk of Kamaelia is a collection of components that use Axon. These range from components for building network servers and clients using TCP and Multicast, through to music playback, audio codec decode through to components suitable for viewing network topologies and interactive systems - such as networked personal autocues. For details of example systems (including audio streaming) implemented using Kamaelia, please see the <a href="KamaeliaStatus.html">status</a> page.</p>
<p>We expect to add a projects page to the site shortly regarding systems either under construction, or that would be interesting to work on.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to build out <a href="Docs/index.html">documentation </a>on the website. We believe Axon to be largely feature complete given that it's functionality has been driven by application spikes. The Kamaelia system itself is now largely complete for building TCP &amp; Multicast based servers and clients - two common classes of network server. A small number of trivial example protocols are included.</p>

<p><a href="Licensing.html"><span style="font-weight:600">Licensing:</span></a></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>See <a href="COPYING">COPYING</a> for complete details, but as a <span style="font-style:italic">guide</span>: Kamaelia is released under the Mozilla trilicense scheme (MPL/GPL/LGPL). This essentially means that if you change any files released you must license them under the same terms, but if you merely <span style="font-style:italic">use </span>the files, you only have to pass on the files you use. We view inheritance from classes in Axon as usage since this is generally how the component classes are intended to be used. Alternatively licensing <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> also be granted if appropriate.</li>
