A networked unix pipe for the 21st century - a way of making general concurrency easy to work with, and fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">But what is it?</span></p>
<p>A framework providing the <a href="/Docs/Axon.html">nuts and bolts</a> for building components. A <a href="/Components.html">library of components</a> built using that framework. Components are implemented at the lowest level as python generators, and communicate by message passing. Components are composed into <a href="/Systems.html">systems</a> in a manner similar to Unix pipelines, but with some twists that are relevent to modern computer systems rather than just file-like systems.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">Why?</span></p>
<p>To enable programmers of all skill levels with playing with components in a networked environment. Network systems are naturally concurrent, and concurrency is often hard. Kamaelia is trying to make concurrency natural and  easy to work with, because we are trying to solve some specific <a href="/Challenges/">challenges</a> regarding putting (some or all of) the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> Archive online. Lego, K'Nex and building blocks are great metaphors for systems like unix pipelines that have made concurrency easy (in a constrained way) for 30 years.</p>
<p><a href="KamaeliaStatus.html"><span style="font-weight:600">What Stage Is The Project At ?</span></a></p>
<p>Axon - the core concurrency framework - is considered API stable (current version 1.1.2). Kamaelia - the library of components - is considered still in development stage, since we recognise there's a lot more to do (current version 0.3.0). However generally this is regarding adding features rather than removing or changing. <a href="/Components.html">Components</a> that exist today, for building <a href="/Systems.html">systems</a>:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Components for TCP servers, multicast servers, backplanes, chassis, video encoding &amp; decoding (using the BBC's Dirac codec), decoding and playback of audio &amp; music encoded using ogg vorbis, creating user interfaces using python's favourite API for SDL (ie pygame :-), and Tk based user interfaces. There's also tools for visualisation[*], presentations, and a host of other random things. (including some tools for building games. The layout tools for this actually come from an old lava lamp simulator, so they've based on a physics/emergent model which I find nice to look at and seems to fascinate geeks and small children alike :-):-)</li></ul>
<p>Finally in terms of tools, we have:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>An &quot;axon shell&quot;, which is an Axon/Kamaelia aware IPython/unix shell.</li>
<li>A visualiser</li>
<li>A visual pipeline builder (which creates code for you based on your point, click and dragging).</li></ul>
<p>This allows you to build systems ranging from viewing network topologies and interactive systems through to networked personal autocues. For details of example systems (including audio streaming) implemented using Kamaelia, please see the <a href="KamaeliaStatus.html">status</a> page.</p>
<p>We expect to add a projects page to the site shortly regarding systems either under construction, or that would be interesting to work on.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to build out <a href="Docs/index.html">documentation </a>on the website. We believe Axon to be largely feature complete given that it's functionality has been driven by application spikes. The Kamaelia system itself is now largely complete for building TCP &amp; Multicast based servers and clients - two common classes of network server. A small number of trivial example protocols are included.</p>

<ul type="disc"><li>See <a href="COPYING">COPYING</a> for complete details, but as a <span style="font-style:italic">guide</span>: Kamaelia is released under the Mozilla trilicense scheme (MPL/GPL/LGPL).

We view inheritance from classes in Axon as usage since this is generally how the component classes are intended to be used. Alternatively licensing <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> also be granted if appropriate.</li>

<p>Old description, to be migrated into better docs: (Probably onto the components page)</p>
<p>A way of treating software like toy building blocks (pick your favourite construction toy!), by using generators to represent blocks (components) and out lists (outboxes and inboxes) as links between them. The current focus of the system is on building network servers and network server systems, however it can equally easily be used for GUI based interactive systems.</p>
<p>The basic system is written in python using generators. Generators can be thought of as resumable functions. The approach for building components and systems is similar to using Unix command line pipes, CSP and hardware. Specifically you write small focussed components which only know about their local inputs and outputs. Interesting systems are then composed using linkages, creating networks of components linking outboxes to inboxes, in a similar way that unix pipelines create interesting systems by linking stdout to stdin between successive programs. </p>
<p>This differs from many other systems like in that it doesn't use essentially a state machine based approach, rather relying on the python language to provide the basic concurrency requirements. This approach is however somewhat experimental, and at this stage not as efficient, however this will change. If you are looking to build a production system Kamaelia is probably not appropriate at present.</p>
<p>Take a TCP server as an example. You have a generic TCP server component that accepts a protocol component. That server component handles then everything except the actual protocol. The work in creating (and hence testing and experimenting) is then limited to just writing your protocol. You don't have to consider basic network server scaling issues, you don't need to restructure your protocol to fit a framework (thereby making it more difficult to experiment with the protocol), you just write the protocol. You can also test the protocol in isolation from the network making protocol testing and compliance testing significantly simpler.</p>
<p>ie the key difference from traditional software systems is that people are able to write new components and network protocols for the system using simple techniques to integrate with a larger testbed framework. The approach is inspired directly from the techniques used for asynchronous hardware construction. More documentation will be added as we do on, but for now there is documentation in the CVS tree.
