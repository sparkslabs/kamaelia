<p><a href="Docs/Axon.html">Core subsystem Axon</a>:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Released Axon 1.0 as a discrete bundle. This is available from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kamaelia/">sourceforge project page</a>.<br />This is sufficiently stable in terms of API and coverage in terms of testcases to be used as is. It should work with python 2.2 onwards. The rest of Kamaelia relies on this core set of modules. We believe Axon to be largely feature complete given that it's functionality has been driven by application spikes. Documentation for Axon is in the process of collation into this website, with the <a href="Docs/Axon.html">main starting page here</a>.</li></ul>
<p>Other Kamaelia Modules &amp; comments:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div>We have recently made our code available as a CVS release for developers who are interested at this stage. We are slowly moving documentation and material describing the motivation into both the website and documentation. The project changed to a largely test-first approach late in the project, and some test suites are being implemented. The Kamaelia system itself is now largely complete for building TCP based servers - the most common class of network server. A small number of trivial <a href="Docs/NetworkProtocolModules.html">example protocols</a> are included.</div></ul>
