<p>We have recently made our code available as a CVS release for developers who are interested at this stage. We are slowly moving documentation and material describing the motivation into both the website and documentation. The project changed to a largely test-first approach late in the project, and some test suites are being implemented. However the core of the system, Axon, we believe to be largely feature complete given that it's functionality has been driven by application spikes. The Kamaelia system itself is now largely complete for building TCP based servers - the most common class of network server. A small number of trivial example protocols are included.</p>
