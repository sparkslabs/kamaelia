<h1>Kamaelia.Chassis.Carousel.Carousel</h1>
<h2>class Carousel(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    Carousel(...) -> new Carousel chassis component (see __init__)
    
    A carousel component that makes child components one at a time
    and lets them do their stuff. Replacing them when they terminate or if
    requested to do so.

</pre>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : 
<li>   _control : internal use: to receive 'producerFinished' or 'shutdownMicroprocess' from child
<li>   inbox : child's inbox
<li>   next : requests to replace child
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : child's outbox
<li>   signal : 
<li>   _signal : internal use: for sending 'shutdownMicroprocess' to child
<li>   requestNext : for requesting new child component
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
<h3>__init__(self, componentFactory, make1stRequest)</h3>
<pre>
    __init__(componentFactory)
    __init__(componentFactory,make1stRequest=True)
    
    componentFactory(argument) -> new component
        factory function for creating a new child according to specified arguments
    
    make1stRequest = True
        Carousel will, immediately after activation, send a "NEXT" message to its
        "requestNext" outbox. Otherwise the carousel just waits. 

</pre>

<h3>handleFinishedChild(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Unplugs the child if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished message is
    received from it. Also sends a "NEXT" request if one has not already been sent.

</pre>

<h3>handleNewChild(self)</h3>
<pre>
    If data received on "next" inbox, removes any existing child and creates and wires
    in a new one.
    
    Received data is passed as an argument to the factory function (supplied at
    initialisation) that creates the new child.

</pre>

<h3>main(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Main loop

</pre>

<h3>requestNext(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Sends 'next' out the 'requestNext' outbox

</pre>

<h3>shutdown(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Returns True if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished message was received.

</pre>

<h3>unplugChildren(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Sends 'shutdownMicroprocess' to children and unwires and disowns them.

</pre>
