<h1>Kamaelia.Codec.RawYUVFramer.RawYUVFramer</h1>
<h2>class RawYUVFramer(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    Receives a raw data stream containing YUV data and frames it
    
           Outputting one frame at a time, as separate YUV planes, with additional metadata.
    
           frame format:
                   { "size" : (pixels_width, pixels_height),
                     "pixformat" : pixel data format (see below)
                     "yuv" : ( ydata_string, udata_string, vdata_string ),
                   }
    
           Incoming data should be a byte stream as strings. They can be of any chunk size.
    
           Currently supported pixel formats:
               
             "YUV420_planar" - (y,u,v) where u and v are half horizontal and vertical resolutions
        

</pre>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : Secondary inbox often used for signals. The closest analogy is unix signals
<li>   inbox : Default inbox for bulk data. Used in a pipeline much like stdin
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
<h3>__init__(self, size, pixformat)</h3>
<pre>
     

</pre>

<h3>flushFrame(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Send out a frame, flushing buffers

</pre>

<h3>main(self)</h3>
<pre>
     

</pre>

<h3>packAndSend(self, raw)</h3>
<pre>
    Pack incoming raw data into y,u,v planes, and trigger flushes when they fill

</pre>
