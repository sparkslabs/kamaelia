<h1>Kamaelia.Util.FilterComponent.FilterComponent</h1>
<h2>class FilterComponent(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    This filter should be passed a filter object at creation which will define its behaviour.
       NOTE: This class can do more than filtering, it adapts any normal class that processes
       data for use as a component.  It could for example be used to proved debug printout
       with a print and return object.

</pre>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : Secondary inbox often used for signals. The closest analogy is unix signals
<li>   inbox : Default inbox for bulk data. Used in a pipeline much like stdin
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
<h3>__init__(self, filter)</h3>
<pre>
    The default filter is simply a passthrough that does no real work.

</pre>

<h3>closeDownComponent(self)</h3>
<pre>
     

</pre>

<h3>mainBody(self)</h3>
<pre>
    This passes data to the filter object and sends it on to the "outbox".  It also
          shutsdown on producerFinished messages to the "control" box.

</pre>
