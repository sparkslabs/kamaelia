<h1>Kamaelia.File.Reading.PromptedFileReader</h1>
<h2>class PromptedFileReader(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    Provides read access to a file.
          You request numbers of bytes/lines of data.
          Data is returned in response.
          
          Bytes returned as a single string
          Line(s) returned as a single string
          
          Shuts down in response to a shutdownMicroprocess message
       

</pre>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : 
<li>   inbox : requests to 'n' read bytes/lines
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : data output
<li>   signal : outputs 'producerFinished' after all data has been read
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
<h3>__init__(self, filename, readmode)</h3>

    Initialisation
           
              filename = name of file to read data from
              readmode = "bytes" to read in 'n' byte chunks
                       = "lines" to read 'n' line chunks
                          ('n' sent to inbox to request the data)
