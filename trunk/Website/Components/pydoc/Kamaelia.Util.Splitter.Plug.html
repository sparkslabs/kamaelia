<h1>Kamaelia.Util.Splitter.Plug</h1>
<h2>class Plug(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    A 'plug' for getting another component to 'plug-into' a splitter.
    
        A splitter is any component with a 'configuration' inbox that will accept
        addSink and removeSink messages.
    
        This component provides encapsulation for that which you wish to plug in.
    
        Usage:
            mysplitter = PlugSplitter(...)
            plug = Plug(mysplitter, Destination)
    
            mysplitter.activate()
            plug.activate()
        

</pre>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : 
<li>   inbox : 
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : 
<li>   signal : 
<li>   splitter_config : Used to communicate with the target splitter
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
<h3>__init__(self, splitter, component)</h3>
<pre>
    Initialisation.
               splitter = the splitter you want to plug 'component' into
               component = the component to be plugged into 'splitter'
            

</pre>

<h3>childrenDone(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Unplugs any children that have terminated, and returns true if there are no
                running child components left (ie. their microproceses have finished)

<h3>main(self)</h3>
