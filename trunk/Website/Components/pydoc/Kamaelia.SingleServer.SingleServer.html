<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
