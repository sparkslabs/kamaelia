<h1>Kamaelia.Util.Comparator.comparator</h1>
<h2>class comparator(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>This class was originally written to assist in testing by making it easy</dt>
<dd>to compare an expected data stream with that from the tested system.
This is the current equality test between the two inputs.  I have however
realised that this can be generalised by making an overidable compare
function to do the real work.  Then I realised that it is in fact a general
system for combining two inputs into a single output!</dd>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   inA : Code uses old style inbox/outbox description - no metadata available
<li>   inB : Code uses old style inbox/outbox description - no metadata available
<li>   control : Code uses old style inbox/outbox description - no metadata available
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
