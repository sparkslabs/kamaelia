<h1>Kamaelia.Util.Comparator.comparator</h1>
<h2>class comparator(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    This class was originally written to assist in testing by making it easy
        to compare an expected data stream with that from the tested system.
        This is the current equality test between the two inputs.  I have however
        realised that this can be generalised by making an overidable compare
        function to do the real work.  Then I realised that it is in fact a general
        system for combining two inputs into a single output!

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   inA : Code uses old style inbox/outbox description - no metadata available
<li>   inB : Code uses old style inbox/outbox description - no metadata available
<li>   control : Code uses old style inbox/outbox description - no metadata available
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
<h3>combine(self, valA, valB)</h3>
<pre>
    Overide this function to change the type of comparison from equality testing.

</pre>

<h3>mainBody(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Checks for equality on both inA and inB and outputs True or False.

</pre>
