<h1>Kamaelia.Util.Splitter.PlugSplitter</h1>
<h2>class PlugSplitter(Axon.AdaptiveCommsComponent.AdaptiveCommsComponent)</h2>

<pre>
    Experimental version of Splitter (written from scratch)
    
           Provides fan-out of incoming messages on both 'inbox' and 'control' to
           component's that request it (they specify which inbox(es) to send the data
           to.
    
           Also supports encapsulation of the source of its data - specifying a component
           in the initialiser for this class will wire that component in as the source
           feeding the splitter. This has been done to experiment with ways of expressing
           the wiring up of your system in a readable but neat fashion.
    
           This version is used by the pipe builder tool at present.

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : 
<li>   _control : Internal inbox for receiving from the child source component (if it exists)
<li>   configuration : 
<li>   inbox : 
<li>   _inbox : Internal inbox for receiving from the child source component (if it exists)
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
