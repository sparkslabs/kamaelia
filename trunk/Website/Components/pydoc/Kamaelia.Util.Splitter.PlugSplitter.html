<h1>Kamaelia.Util.Splitter.PlugSplitter</h1>
<h2>class PlugSplitter(Axon.AdaptiveCommsComponent.AdaptiveCommsComponent)</h2>

<p>Experimental version of Splitter (written from scratch)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provides fan-out of incoming messages on both 'inbox' and 'control' to
component's that request it (they specify which inbox(es) to send the data
to.</p>
<p>Also supports encapsulation of the source of its data - specifying a component
in the initialiser for this class will wire that component in as the source
feeding the splitter. This has been done to experiment with ways of expressing
the wiring up of your system in a readable but neat fashion.</p>
<p>This version is used by the pipe builder tool at present.</p>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : 
<li>   _control : Internal inbox for receiving from the child source component (if it exists)
<li>   configuration : 
<li>   inbox : 
<li>   _inbox : Internal inbox for receiving from the child source component (if it exists)
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
