<h1>Kamaelia.ReadFileAdaptor.ReadFileAdaptor</h1>
<h2>class ReadFileAdaptor(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>An instance of this class is a read file adaptor component. It's</dt>
<dd><p class="first">constructor arguments are all optional. If no arguments are provided,
then the default is to read from stdin, one line at a time, as fast as
possible. Note that this will cause the outbox to fill at the same rate
as stdin can provide data. (Be wary of memory constraints this will
cause!)</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Arguments &amp; meaning:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first simple">
<li>filename=&quot;filename&quot; - the name of the file to read. If you want stdin,</li>
</ul>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<tt class="docutils">&lt;string&gt;</tt>, line 10)</p>
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</div>
<p>do not provide a filename! If you want the output from a command,
also leave this blank...
* command=&quot;command&quot; - the name of the command you want the
output from. Leave the filename blank if you use this!
* readmode - possible values:</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<tt class="docutils">&lt;string&gt;</tt>, line 15)</p>
Unexpected indentation.</div>
<blockquote>
&quot;bitrate&quot; - read at a specified bitrate.</blockquote>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<tt class="docutils">&lt;string&gt;</tt>, line 16)</p>
Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</div>
<p class="last">&quot;line&quot; - read on a line by line basis
&quot;block&quot; - read the file on a block by block basis.
* If bitrate mode is set, you should set bitrate= to your
desired bitrate (unless you want 64Kbit/s), and chunkrate=
to your desired chunkrate (unless you want 24 fps). You are
expected to be able to handle the bit rate you request!
* If block mode is set then you should set readsize (size of the
block in bytes), and steptime (how often you want bytes). If
steptime is set to zero, you will read blocks at the speed the
source device can provide them. (be wary of memory constraints)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After setting the ReadFileAdaptor in motion, you can then hook it into
your linkages like any other component, and it's interfaces are:</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<tt class="docutils">&lt;string&gt;</tt>, line 29)</p>
Unexpected indentation.</div>
<blockquote class="last">
<ul class="simple">
<li>inboxes=[&quot;inbox&quot;] - not actually read at present</li>
<li>outboxes=[&quot;outbox&quot;]) - When data is read, it is made available here.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : Secondary inbox often used for signals. The closest analogy is unix signals
<li>   inbox : Default inbox for bulk data. Used in a pipeline much like stdin
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

[[boxright][[include][file=Components/MethodNote.html][croptop=1][crop
bottom=1] ] ]
<h3>__init__(self, filename, command, readmode, readsize, steptime, bitrate, chunkrate, debug)</h3>
<p>Standard constructor, see class docs for details</p>
<h3>closeDownComponent(self)</h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>#!!!! Called at component exit...</dt>
<dd>Closes the file handle</dd>
</dl>
<h3>getDataByteLen(self)</h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>This method attempts to read data of a specific block size from</dt>
<dd>the file handle. If null, the file is EOF. This method is never called
directly. If the readmode is block or bitrate, then the attribute self.getData
is set to this function, and then this function is called using self.getData().
The reason for this indirection is to make it so that the check for
which readmode we are in is done once, and once only</dd>
</dl>
<h3>getDataReadline(self)</h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>This method attempts to read a line of data from the file handle.</dt>
<dd>If null, the file is EOF. As with getDataByteLen, this method is never called
directly. If the readmode is readline (or &quot;&quot;), then the attribute self.getData
is set to this function, and then this function is called using self.getData().
Same reason for indirection as above.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>initialiseComponent(self)</h3>
<p>Opens the appropriate file handle</p>
<h3>mainBody(self)</h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>We check whether it's time to perform a new read, if it is, we</dt>
<dd>read some data. If we get some data, we put it in out outbox
&quot;outbox&quot;, and to stdout (if debugging).
If we had an error state (eg EOF), we return 0, stopping this component, otherwise
we return 1 to live for another line/block.</dd>

<P>Got a problem with the documentation? Something unclear, could
be clearer? Want to help with improving? Constructive criticism,
preferably in the form of suggested rewording is very welcome.
