<h1>Kamaelia.ReadFileAdaptor.ReadFileAdaptor</h1>
<h2>class ReadFileAdaptor(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    An instance of this class is a read file adaptor component. It's
       constructor arguments are all optional. If no arguments are provided,
       then the default is to read from stdin, one line at a time, as fast as
       possible. Note that this will cause the outbox to fill at the same rate
       as stdin can provide data. (Be wary of memory constraints this will
       cause!)
    
       Arguments & meaning:
          * filename="filename" - the name of the file to read. If you want stdin,
          do not provide a filename! If you want the output from a command,
          also leave this blank...
          * command="command" - the name of the command you want the
          output from. Leave the filename blank if you use this!
          * readmode - possible values:
             "bitrate" - read at a specified bitrate.
          "line" - read on a line by line basis
          "block" - read the file on a block by block basis.
          * If bitrate mode is set, you should set bitrate= to your
          desired bitrate (unless you want 64Kbit/s), and chunkrate=
          to your desired chunkrate (unless you want 24 fps). You are
          expected to be able to handle the bit rate you request!
          * If block mode is set then you should set readsize (size of the
          block in bytes), and steptime (how often you want bytes). If
          steptime is set to zero, you will read blocks at the speed the
          source device can provide them. (be wary of memory constraints)
    
       After setting the ReadFileAdaptor in motion, you can then hook it into
       your linkages like any other component, and it's interfaces are:
          * inboxes=["inbox"] - not actually read at present
          * outboxes=["outbox"]) - When data is read, it is made available here.
       

</pre>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : Secondary inbox often used for signals. The closest analogy is unix signals
<li>   inbox : Default inbox for bulk data. Used in a pipeline much like stdin
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
<h3>__init__(self, filename, command, readmode, readsize, steptime, bitrate, chunkrate, debug)</h3>
<pre>
    Standard constructor, see class docs for details

</pre>

<h3>closeDownComponent(self)</h3>
<pre>
    #!!!! Called at component exit...
          Closes the file handle

</pre>

<h3>getDataByteLen(self)</h3>
<pre>
    This method attempts to read data of a specific block size from
          the file handle. If null, the file is EOF. This method is never called
          directly. If the readmode is block or bitrate, then the attribute self.getData
          is set to this function, and then this function is called using self.getData().
          The reason for this indirection is to make it so that the check for
          which readmode we are in is done once, and once only

</pre>

<h3>getDataReadline(self)</h3>
<pre>
    This method attempts to read a line of data from the file handle.
          If null, the file is EOF. As with getDataByteLen, this method is never called
          directly. If the readmode is readline (or ""), then the attribute self.getData
          is set to this function, and then this function is called using self.getData().
          Same reason for indirection as above.

</pre>

<h3>initialiseComponent(self)</h3>
<pre>
    Opens the appropriate file handle

</pre>

<h3>mainBody(self)</h3>
<pre>
    We check whether it's time to perform a new read, if it is, we
          read some data. If we get some data, we put it in out outbox
          "outbox", and to stdout (if debugging).
          If we had an error state (eg EOF), we return 0, stopping this component, otherwise
          we return 1 to live for another line/block.
