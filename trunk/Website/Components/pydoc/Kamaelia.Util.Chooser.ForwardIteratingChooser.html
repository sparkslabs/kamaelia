<h1>Kamaelia.Util.Chooser.ForwardIteratingChooser</h1>
<h2>class ForwardIteratingChooser(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    Iterates forwards items out of something iterable, as directed by commands sent to its inbox.
    
          Emits the first item at initialisation, then whenever a command is received
          it emits another item (unless you're asking it to step beyond the end of the set)
    
          Stepping beyond the end will cause this component to shutdown and emit a producerFinished msg
       

</pre>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : 
<li>   inbox : receive commands
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : emits chosen items
<li>   signal : 
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
