<h1>Kamaelia.Codec.Dirac.DiracEncoder</h1>
<h2>class DiracEncoder(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    Dirac encoder component
    
           Encodes dirac video!
    
           Receives frame dictionaries containing a 'yuv' key containing (y,u,v)
           tuple of strings
    
           Emits byte stream as strings
    
           Finishes the stream in response to a producerFinished msg.
           shutdownMicroprocess does not do this, but will still shut the component
           down.
    
           Does not yet support output of instrumentation or locally decoded frames

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : Secondary inbox often used for signals. The closest analogy is unix signals
<li>   inbox : Default inbox for bulk data. Used in a pipeline much like stdin
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
<h3>__init__(self, preset, verbose, encParams, seqParams)</h3>
<pre>
    Initialisation.
    
            Either specify a preset and/or encoder and sequence parameters
            to set up the encoder. Any encoder or sequence params manually specified will
            override those specified through a preset.
    
            bufsize is recommended to be at least 1 MByte. It is the buffer into which the
            compressed stream is output. If the buffer size is too small, the encoder will
            generate errors.
