<h2>class Introspector(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<p>This component introspects the current local topology of an axon system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Local? This component examines its scheduler to find components and postmen.
It then examines them to determine their inboxes and outboxes and the linkages
between them.</p>
<p>If this component is not active, then it will see no scheduler and will report nothing.</p>
<p>The output is a description of the a graph topology, where components and postboxes
are the nodes, and their relationships/linkages form the links between them. As the
shape of the graph changes, this component relays only the changes.</p>
<p>The output format is a stream of strings, designed to be fed to an AxonVisualiserServer
component.</p>

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : Secondary inbox often used for signals. The closest analogy is unix signals
<li>   inbox : Default inbox for bulk data. Used in a pipeline much like stdin
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
