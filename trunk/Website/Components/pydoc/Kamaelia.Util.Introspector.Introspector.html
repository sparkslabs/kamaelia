<h1>Kamaelia.Util.Introspector.Introspector</h1>
<h2>class Introspector(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<pre>
    This component introspects the current local topology of an axon system.
        
        Local? This component examines its scheduler to find components and postmen.
        It then examines them to determine their inboxes and outboxes and the linkages
        between them.
        
        If this component is not active, then it will see no scheduler and will report nothing.
        
        The output is a description of the a graph topology, where components and postboxes
        are the nodes, and their relationships/linkages form the links between them. As the
        shape of the graph changes, this component relays only the changes.
        
        The output format is a stream of strings, designed to be fed to an AxonVisualiserServer
        component.

<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : Secondary inbox often used for signals. The closest analogy is unix signals
<li>   inbox : Default inbox for bulk data. Used in a pipeline much like stdin
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : Default data out outbox, used in a pipeline much like stdout
<li>   signal : The default signal based outbox - kinda like stderr, but more for sending singal type signals
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

*NOTE:* Aside from the __init__ method, which is defined above, you
should not be using these methods, unless you're either a) subclassing
this component and overriding specific behaviour. b) looking to modify
this class.

If you are simply using this component, you should not need to call
any of these methods, and things might well break (unless otherwise
noted) if you do.
