<ul type="disc"><li dir="ltr">[[boxright] [[IMG][SRC=http://conferences.oreillynet.com/images/eurooscon/banners/speakers/210x60.gif][align=left]] ]19 October 2005 - <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/">Euro OSCON</a> - <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7252">Kamaelia: Using Communicating Python Generators to Build Concurrent and Network Systems Easily</a> - this will be a technical update of the talks given earlier in the year at Python UK &amp; Europython, along with an introduction to Kamaelia.</li></ul>
<p>Recent notable activity in the project (most recent first)</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>20 August 2005 - <a href="http://www.fave.org.uk/mambo/">FAVE</a> - &quot;Open Source Creativity&quot; - FAVE is a community event for creative people who are interested in free and open source software on Linux and other computer platforms. </li>
<li>23 July 2005 - Talk on Kamaelia at - <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/ ">Open Tech 2005</a> - Short talk on Kamaelia &quot;Kamaelia - Taking back the pipeline&quot;, focussed on <span style="font-style:italic">what you can do with Kamaelia today.</span> <a href="http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Kamaelia_OT2005.tgz">&quot;Slides&quot; can be found here.</a> Much like the Europython talk, this in fact a bundle of Kamaelia &amp; Axon in a single tar ball with the slides and a slideshow presentation. The reason for this is the slides also have a dynamic representation of the graphlines. The slides are covered by the same license as the rest of Kamaelia (due to being code).</li>
<li>27 - 29 June 2005 - Talk on Kamaelia at <a href="http://www.europython.org/">Europython</a>. The <a href="http://www.python-in-business.org/ep2005/talk.chtml?talk=2589&track=692">slides are available on this page</a>, and are actually displayed using a Kamaelia application. The reason for this is because it has an interactive element for displaying Kamaelia Pipe- &amp; Graph-lines.</li>
<li>June 2005 - BBC R&amp;D Open Days - a lot of work went into visualisation of Kamaelia systems, which is feeding into the 0.2.0 release. Two documents were produced for this:</li>
<ul type="disc"><li>BBC R&amp;D White Paper 113 - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp113.shtml">Kamaelia: highly concurrent and network systems tamed</a></li>
<li>Grand Challenges: The Changing Landscape of Online Delivery - this will appear online shortly in HTML form, but for now the PDF of this is included in &quot;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp115.shtml">The handouts from the 2005 Open Days</a>&quot; (BBC R&amp;D White Paper 115)<br />This document is important for Kamaelia since it describes the <span style="font-style:italic">motivations </span>behind the Kamaelia project.</li></ul>
<li>Talk at Open Source Forum Russia, on <a href="http://www.opensource-forum.ru/speakers/sparks.pdf">Open Source at the BBC</a> (why the BBC uses/releases open source - short answer: we're not a technology company, we use technology, and evaluate/release based on merit)</li>
