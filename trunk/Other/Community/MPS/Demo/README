This is the example/template package for packaging up Kamaelia based
modules, and systems. This is designed to assist you with collaborating
with the rest of the Kamaelia community!

Firstly, remove the following files:
|-- Kamaelia
|   |-- Community
|   |   |-- MPS
|   |   |   |-- Demo.py
...
|-- Tests
|   `-- test_Kamaelia.Community.MPS.Demo.py

And replace with your own tests and code. (name all tests files "test_*"

Secondly, DO CHANGE the following files to match your own details/project:
|-- AUTHORS   **
|-- CHANGELOG   **
|-- COPYING   **
|-- Docs
|   `-- README   **
|-- Kamaelia
|   |-- Community
|   |   |-- MPS   ** directory name(!)
...
|-- MANIFEST.in
|-- README   ** (this file!)
|-- Tests
|   |-- README   **
...
`-- setup.py   ** (description, target filename, etc...)

Thirdly, to actually build a distribution, simply type:
   python setup.py sdist

You will then be left with a distribution in "dist", which you can then
share with everyone else. If you need any help with this process, please
email kamaelia-list@lists.sourceforge.net !

Have fun!


Michael.
