Music Timing Component
======================

This component provides a scheduler and a musical "clock", which keeps time in
beats and bars.  It is designed to be subclassed for use in creating components
to be used in the creation of music.

Example usage
-------------

A simple class which prints the beat and bar every half-beat

class HalfBeatPrint(MusicTimingComponent):
    def __init__(self):
        super(HalfBeatPrint, self).__init__()
        self.lastHalfBeatTime = self.startTime
        self.halfBeatLength = self.beatLength/2
        # Use priority=2 so beat/bar rolls over first
        self.sched.enterabs(self.lastHalfBeatTime + self.halfBeatLength, 2,
                            self.printPosition, ())

    def printPosition(self):
        print "Beat: %i, Bar: %i" % (self.beat, self.bar)
        self.lastHalfBeatTime = self.lastHalfBeatTime + self.halfBeatLength
        # Reschedule the event for the next half-beat
        self.sched.enterabs(self.lastHalfBeatTime + self.halfBeatLength, 2,
                            self.printPosition, ())
   
How does it work?
-----------------

When initialized the component creates a number of variables relating to the
time.  It then creates a scheduler from python's sched module.  An event is
scheduled to call updateBeat() after a beat has passed.  updateBeat() updates
the various timing variables, and then schedules a new event to wake the
component after another beat has passed.  When subclassed the child can add
events to the scheduler allowing it to sleep until something needs doing (e.g.
a note needs playing).

Currently there is no compensation for the lack of real-time scheduling, so
events are processed slightly later than the time which is specified to the
scheduler.
