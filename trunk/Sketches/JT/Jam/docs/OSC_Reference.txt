For users
=========

By default Jam outputs the following OSC messages to use for music making.

XY Pads
-------
Messages from XY pads are output with the address /Jam/XY/{N}/, where {N} is an integer representing which XY pad the message originates from.

- /Jam/XY/{N}/Position [xPos, yPos] -- The position of the puck on an XY pad.  xPos and yPos are floats between 0 and 1, with [0, 0] being the top-left corner.
- /Jam/XY/{N}/Top [1] -- The puck has bounced from the top wall of the pad.
- /Jam/XY/{N}/Right [1] -- The puck has bounced from the right wall of the pad.
- /Jam/XY/{N}/Bottom [1] -- The puck has bounced from the bottom wall of the pad.
- /Jam/XY/{N}/Left [1] -- The puck has bounced from the right wall of the pad.

Step Sequencer
--------------
Messages from the Step Sequencer are output with the address /Jam/StepSequencer.

- /Jam/StepSequencer/On [channel] [velocity] -- A note-on message from a certain channel (zero-indexed from top to bottom).  The velocity is a float between 0 and 1.


For developers
==============

For internal communication between components and instances of Jam the following OSC messages are used.

XY Pads
-------
Messages from XY pads are output with the address /Jam/XY/{N}/, where {N} is an integer representing which XY pad the message originates from.

- /Jam/XY/{N}/Position [xPos, yPos] -- The position of the puck on an XY pad.  xPos and yPos are floats between 0 and 1, with [0, 0] being the top-left corner.
- /Jam/XY/{N}/Velocity [xVel, yVel] -- The velocity of the puck on an XY pad.  xVel and yVel are floats working on a relatively arbitrary scale (something like px per frame I think).  For the moment however this doesn't seem to matter too much...

StepSequencer
-------------

Messages from the Step Sequencer are output with the address /Jam/StepSequencer.

- /Jam/StepSequencer/Add [stepNumber channel velocity] -- The user has turned a step on.  channel and stepNumber are both zero indexed integers, working from top-to-bottom and left-to-right respectively.  The velocity is a float between 0 and 1.
- /Jam/StepSequencer/Remove [stepNumber channel] -- The user has turned a step off.  channel and stepNumber are both zero indexed integers, working from top-to-bottom and left-to-right respectively.
- /Jam/StepSequencer/Velocity [stepNumber channel velocity] -- The user has changed the velocity of a step.  channel and stepNumber are both zero indexed integers, working from top-to-bottom and left-to-right respectively.  The velocity is a float between 0 and 1.
