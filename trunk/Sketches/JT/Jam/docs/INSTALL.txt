Kamaelia Jam Install Instructions
=================================

Dependencies
============
Hard dependencies
-----------------
Jam only has two hard dependencies, on pygame and pyOSC

pygame
~~~~~~
Packages for pygame, along with install instructions are available from http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.

pyOSC
~~~~~
The latest version of pyOSC is availble from http://trac.v2.nl/wiki/pyOSC.  To install extract the archive, and move into the newly extracted directory.  From there run the following command as root::

    python setup.py install

Soft dependencies
-----------------
If you want audio or midi support in Jam you also need extra packages.

Audio support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For audio you need the python bindings for RtAudio, which are available in a subversion repository.  Download the latest version by running::

    svn co http://kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kamaelia/trunk/Sketches/JT/RtAudioBinding

Follow the instructions for installation in the INSTALL.txt file

MIDI support
~~~~~~~~~~~~
For midi support you need the pyrtmidi bindings.  Again this is available in a subversion repository.  Download and install the latest version by running::

    svn co http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/pkaudio/pyrtmidi
    cd pyrtmidi
    python setup.py install (as root)

Installing Jam
==============
When you have the dependencies installed you can install jam by extracting the archive, and running the following code as root from within the extracted directory::
    sudo python setup.py install
