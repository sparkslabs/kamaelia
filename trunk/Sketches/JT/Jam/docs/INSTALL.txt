Kamaelia Jam Install Instructions
=================================

Dependencies
============
Hard dependencies
-----------------
Jam only has two hard dependencies, on pygame and pyOSC

pygame
~~~~~~
Packages for pygame, along with install instructions are available from http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.

pyOSC
~~~~~
The latest version of pyOSC is availble from http://trac.v2.nl/wiki/pyOSC.  To install extract the archive, and move into the newly extracted directory.  From there run the following command as root::

    python setup.py install

Soft dependencies
-----------------
If you want audio or midi support in Jam you also need extra packages.

Audio support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For audio you need the numeric python module.  This comes packaged for most major linux distributions and so should be installed via your package manager if possible.

If it is not packaged for your distribution it can be installed from source from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&abmode=1.  A winodws installer is available from the pygame download page at http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.

MIDI support
~~~~~~~~~~~~
For midi support you need the pyrtmidi bindings.  Again this is available in a subversion repository.  Download and install the latest version by running::

    svn co http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/pkaudio/pyrtmidi
    cd pyrtmidi
    python setup.py install (as root)

Installing Jam
==============
When you have the dependencies installed you can install jam by extracting the archive, and running the following code as root from within the extracted directory::
    sudo python setup.py install
