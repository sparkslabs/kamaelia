====================================
Getting started with Jam and PureJam
====================================

So, you've downloaded Jam, navigated the (slightly skimpy) install
instructions.  You've started up it up, marvelled at the beautiful UI, clicked
a few buttons.  But now you'd really quite like to hear some sound out of it.
Well, you've come to the right place.  Or rather you haven't, because by itself
Jam doesn't actually make any sound.  Instead it outputs OSC messages which are
understood by a number of other programs which will make sound out of them.
For a (incomplete) list of programs which support OSC messages see
http://opensoundcontrol.org/implementations.  This brief guide will take you
through making your first music using Jam and PureData.

PureJam
-------

To assist you with getting started making music using Jam there is a patch for
Pure Data (http://www.puredata.info), PureJam.pd, which is included in the
standard distribution of Jam.  It is recommended that you use one of the
PD-extended builds of Pure Data available from http://puredata.info/downloads,
otherwise some or all of PureJam may not work.

When you have Pure Data installed open up PureJam.pd, and you should see a
number of boxes - these are the PD objects which will interpret the OSC
messages and make the sound.  Towards the bottom of the screen you should see
four sliders - these set the volume of certain elements of the patch.  Make
sure you are not in edit mode (you can see this in the edit menu), and move the
sliders up to about 1/4 of their height.  Then ensure audio is turned on (from
the Media menu) and start up Jam.  If you set the first XY pad bouncing you
should hear percussive noise when the ball hits the wall.  Congratulations!
You are now up and running with Jam.

There are (or at least will be soon) a number of comments in the PureJam patch
describing how it works.  Using them, and the documentation at
http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/Pd_documentation/ and with PD try altering the patch
to change the sound it makes.  You will soon find that you can shape the sound
made using Jam in a number of unexpected ways.  Have fun experimenting!
