TV Bookmarks
- App designed to grab RDF data from BBC /programmes and use it to identify relevant conversation using Twitter.
- Data is then saved and analysed to create bookmarks in programmes which can be jumped to via the iPlayer interface.
- Data will at a later date be enriched to provide some form of explanation to users, identifying why it forms a relevant bookmark.
- If run live enough, could be used to give a live activity EPG with heavily discussed programmes highlighted

Installing
- DB schema MUST be imported from the included SQL file BEFORE executing the Django DB sync as Django can't get it quite right

Proxies
- Currently, a proxy free connection is required due to limitations in the OAuth library. This will be corrected shortly.
