Shard System:
----------------------

The shard system is a code generator that combines
fragments of existing components into new ones. These fragments
are called shards and may be pasted 'inline' into generated
functions, etc. or added as complete functions or methods into a class
or module. This system is fairly low-level and requires a considerable amount
of construction when used 'as-is', future work could provide a text-based
or GUI frontend to the system.

A full example is the reconstruction of the MagnaDoodle
component (found in Kamaelia.UI.Pygame) in MagnaGen.py, it uses
both inline and method shards.
An interface for GUI components can be found in ShardGen.py,
along with a simple example.

The system builds a hierarchy of shards, with each object
containing the code it will output. The constructor is generally
the only method that will be used; it takes task-specific
arguments and usually a list of child shards to include. These
are documented in the class docstring.

This is the base shard constructor that accepts any combination
of the following as child shards: shard objects, function objects
and lists of strings (of code).

Subclass this to create more specific connectors, e.g.
branching, looping, methods, function calls, etc.
Simple examples are the docShard class below, and the
classes in LoopShard.py and BranchShard.py. More complex
examples are in ClassShard.py and PygameComponentShard.py.


Shard Dependencies:
---------------------------------

More complex shards may require specific inline or function shards to fill
certain slots, e.g. the PygameComponentShard requires an event handling
shard. These requirements may be declared and checked for with the
dependency handling functions provided.
These are:

* The exception DependencyError, thrown in the constructor when a
dependency is not supplied

* Instance method checkDependencies, which confirms that both shard and
inline shard dependencies are satisfied and throws a DependencyError if they
are not

* Classmethods addReqMethods, addReqIShards, remReqMethods and
remReqIShards, which add or remove required method/function shards
and inline shards from the  requiredMethods and requiredIShards sets


Shard interface:
-------------------------

All shard subclasses MUST obey the following:

* Inherit from the shard base class or a subclass

* Provide a constructor that generates the relevant code and stores
it as a list of lines terminated by newlines in a self.code attribute

* ALL constructor arguments must be named. If an argument is
absolutely required, its value should be checked in the constructor.
An ArgumentError exception is provided in this module if the check fails

* If any argument is required and checked for, it should be listed in
a self.required attribute. The convention used here is to place this
immediately before the class __init__

* Provide a self.initargs attribute that is a dictionary mapping the
constructor arguments to their default values. The convention used
here is to place this immediately before the class __init__


Shard subclasses may use the following:

* The ArgumentError exception, used when a required parameter
is not supplied (i.e. is left at default value)

* The namegen generator which generates names for shards where
a default value will do

* The dependency declaration, removal and checking methods
described in the Shard Dependencies section above

* The attributes guaranteed to be present by the shard base class:
   - self.code: list of strings of the generated code, newline terminated
   - self.shards: list of shard objects representing those passed to __init__
   - self.name: name of this shard, not necessarily unique
   - self.indent: level of indentation of the code in this shard

* Newline (nl) and indentation strings have been defined in this module
for convenience and consistency
