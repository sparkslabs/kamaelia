"""
The shardGen class is an interface between a GUI node and the
code generation shard system. Each shardGen object wraps a given
shard class and publishes its required and default constructor
arguments. The same interface is provided for all shards so that they
can be queried consistently. Calling makeShard() will produce an object
of the enclosed shard type, initialised appropriately.
The example in this file recreates the pygame event loop from the
MagnaDoodle component (directly generated in full in MagnaGen.py).

From a GUI perspective, the shardGen object provides the default
parameters for the shard it represents (also marking those that are
compulsory for convenience). Where possible, it can store child shards
in a likewise uninitialised state in the form of other shardGen objects.
This is possible wherever the shard class is initialised with a 'shards'
argument listing its children; occasionally this is not the case, for instance
the 'ifShard' class requires that a condition be attached to each child, so
each branch must be specified directly.
Non-shard arguments should be set in the shardGen.args dict directly.

From a code generation perspective, the object supplies the initialised
shard object which automatically generates its own code. Initalisation
of child shards is done by the shardGen object, so a call to makeShard
on a root shardGen object will provide a completely initialised hierarchy
of shards.
