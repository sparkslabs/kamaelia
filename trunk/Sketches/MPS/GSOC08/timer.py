# This code is really testing (sorta) python's resolution of time.sleep
# It's not perfect though because there isn't:
#    * Anything going on in the background on the machine doing the test
#    * Anything else happening in this kamaelia thread
#
# The SpinWait()er helps with showing that this can cause problems...
#
# Added based on discussions regarding time.sleep. Derived from
# http://orphans.pastebin.com/d1dc6ea3b
