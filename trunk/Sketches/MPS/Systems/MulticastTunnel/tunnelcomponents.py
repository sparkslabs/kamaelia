# Multicast to TCP Client components
#
# This looks correct, but needs validation.
#
# Listens on a multicast address, sends all data received over a TCP
# connection to an endpoint. Any data received over the TCP connection is
# retransmitted over the multicast group. This essentially forms a NAT for
# the multicast session.
#
# This will be more generally useful as software we can just give people for
# bypassing the lack of multicast deployment over the internet. (Hmm...
# Thinking about it, this also relieves the more general issues with routing
# since explicit network joins in this manner mean that not everyone needs WAN
# based multicast enabled)
#
# In a fun way this will also allow companies to join a BBC multicast
# group...
