This directory contains libvorbissimple and some basic python bindings.

What is libvorbissimple ? It is an auxillary library to Kamaelia used 
for building simple vorbis decode and playback components. See also
the BytesToBeeps PDF document, which documents the ideas and design
encompassed by this library in detail.

2 sample programs are included using the libraries:
   * simple_decoder.c
   * simple_decoder.py

Both programs do the same thing, but in different languages. The python
version is 60% slower/more CPU intensive that the C version. It is however
more than 60% shorter.
