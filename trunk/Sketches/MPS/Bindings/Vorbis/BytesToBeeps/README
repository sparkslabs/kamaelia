This archive contains the following files:

   * README - this file.

   * VorbisBytesToBeeps.pdf - this is a tutorial/explanation about how to
     build a hypothetical simple decoder (with a reusable core) using
     libvorbis. 

   * src/simple_decoder.c - The main harness for the simple decoder using a
     reusable core.

   * src/libvorbissimple.c - A simple *source code* library forming a reusable
     core. 

   * src/BUILDING - small set of instructions detailing how to build the
     decoder - covers the compile/link stages.

The code forming the simple_decoder was directly derived from the existing
sample decoder - as a result this code/docs is covered by the same license
as the original decoder.
