====================================
Particle Laws for Axon Visualisation
====================================

This class is a specialisation of Kamaelia.Physics.Simple.MultipleLaws that
specifies the laws for particle interactions when visualising Axon/Kamaelia
systems.



Example Usage
-------------
Instantiate a topology viewer using rendering code for each particle type, and the
appropriate laws to govern their interactions::
    visualiser = TopologyViewer( particleTypes={ "component" : PComponent,
                                                 "inbox"     : PPostbox.Inbox,
                                                 "outbox"    : PPostbox.Outbox
                                               },
                                 laws = AxonLaws(),
                               ).activate()



How does it work?
-----------------

AxonLaws is a subclass of MultipleLaws. It sets the bond lengths and strengths 
of forces for two types of particles that represent components and 
inboxes/outboxes respectively. 

These laws are mapped to work for particles identified as being of type
"component" and "postbox".

At initialisation you can specify the length of the postbox to postbox bond
(which represents Axon linkages). The ranges over which forces act (but not their
magnitude) are scaled appropriately.

See MultipleLaws for information on the role of this class for physics
simulation and topology visualisation.
