These files are lightly adapted files from Ciaran Eaton's project whilst
working with the Kamaelia Project at BBC R&D from Janurary 2005. The
adaptations are largely made to remove an assumption of what operating
system the code is running under. 

Also the code branching trying to detect if the code is running on a mobile
or not has been removed. (This works/ed reliably when the only two options
were Windows/Series60, but when extended to Mac OS X, and other unices
becomes too clever for it's own boots :)

The text files are taken from output from the BSD "fortune" program. I
took the photos (for better or worse :), so feel free to use them.
