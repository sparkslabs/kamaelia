Example: Producer Testing

This example shows how to test a component that produces messages.
Specifically, we want to test that a particular set of messages is
produced by it in a given order.

The way the test is structured is as follows:

   * Our component under test is called SimpleComponent
   
   * The class SimpleComponentTestCase is a class that contains the
     tests for this component.
     
     * Individual tests within this class are contained in
       methods named test*

     * This class only contains one such class.


The original "documentation" for this file says this:
    It will call suite() and execute that TestSuite

I can't see (from this file) where that happens, so I can't document that.
