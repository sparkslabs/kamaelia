			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just thought I&#8217;d make a post about some of the miscellaneous goings on inside the Kamaelia project.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.davbo.org/blog/2008/05/22/kamaelia-multicore-support/">Davbo posts about multicore support</a>.  Although somewhat rambling (hey, he says so himself), he brings up some interesting points.</li>
<li>Lawouach makes a long and very informative post about <a href="http://www.defuze.org/archives/18-XMPP,-AtomPub-and-microblogging.html">XMPP, atompub, and microblogging</a>.  I&#8217;m working on reading the whole thing, I promise.  I really need to learn more about XMPP and headstock so that when it comes time to do some stuff with it, I won&#8217;t be totally lost.</li>
<li>In other news, Lawouach was also <a href="http://www.defuze.org/archives/19-They-made-me-do-it....html">forced to use Twitter</a>.  Poor guy.</li>
<li>You can also review the extremely interesting notes of our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kamaelia/msg/561675bea2563212">last meeting</a>.  I know.  Try to contain your excitement.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, not too much has changed since my last post.  I&#8217;m inching towards having better wsgi.errors support, and I think I&#8217;m almost there.  I did also make an attempt at creating a better solution towards managing component shutdown in Kamaelia, but I think until some issues get worked out, it&#8217;s going to be best for testing components.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a little while since I&#8217;ve posted last, and there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s new, so I&#8217;ll enumerate the points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The WSGI code is close to being complete.  There are a couple of caveats though.  First of all, there is no support for the write() callable.  This is important for legacy app support as well as for streaming.  Secondly, the wsgi.errors object still directs to stderr.  There&#8217;s not necessarily anything wrong with this, but it&#8217;s certainly a good idea to have some kind of custom error log (see the next bullet point for more info on how I plan to achieve this).  And lastly, my implementation of wsgi.input can be prone to DOS attacks.  This is definitely something that needs to be fixed, but isn&#8217;t necessarily a first priority for me.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve written a logging component for Kamaelia.  It essentially uses a backplane to register itself to a service.  The idea being that you won&#8217;t necessarily need a reference to any kind of object in order to post messages to a log.  What I&#8217;m working on at the moment is an adapter for this component to act as a wsgi.errors object.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve set up the basic structure of how I think the Descartes server will be.  It&#8217;s far from being distribution ready, but it should be enough to give you the basic idea.  For now, I&#8217;m placing some of the components (like the ServerCore) in my sketches directory as I&#8217;m not sure if any modifications I make to them will necessarily be a good fit for Kamaelia as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s it for now.  I think I may spend a little bit of time reading my start of program present, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211405701&amp;sr=8-1">Beautiful Code</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Ok, so this is one issue that&#8217;s been bugging me about HTTP.  I keep hearing the acronyms URI and URL mentioned.  I knew that URL wasn&#8217;t technically accurate, but I couldn&#8217;t ever find a good explanation of what the difference between the two are or why URI is more technically accurate.  This is even after reading various explanations about the subject.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come up with:</p>
<h2><strong>URI</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A URI is a name that identifies something globally.  Admittedly, this explanation is a little bit vague, but then again the idea of a URI is kind of a vague concept.  We&#8217;ll come back to this later, but I&#8217;ll give you a few examples of URIs:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<pre>http://www.coderspalace.com</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>http://www.coderspalace.com/index.php</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>file://usr/lib/python</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>URL</h2>
<p>A URL is a special kind of URI.  It gives you more precise instructions on <em>where </em>something is located.  Thus, something like <kbd>http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker/</kbd> will tell you what computer a webpage is and will even narrow down where the webpage is located, but it won&#8217;t give you an exact location of the file like <kbd>http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker/index.php</kbd> will.</p>
<p>So I suppose the next question is: who cares?  The point is that nowadays you don&#8217;t really need the level of precision that a URL requires and haven&#8217;t for a long time.  Try going to <a href="http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker/">http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker/</a> and <a title="http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker" href="http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker/index.php">http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker/index.php</a> and see if you get any difference between the two links.  You won&#8217;t.  This is because my webserver is smart enough to know that when you go to <kbd>http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker/</kbd> you <em>really</em> mean <kbd>http://www.coderspalace.com/j_baker/index.php</kbd>.  Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p>Gloria from DevChix writes about Kamaelia.  It is nice to see that the project is gaining some attention from others.  Gloria does bring up one important point though:  installing some of the dependencies for Kamaelia is a pain.  Especially if you&#8217;re a newbie.  Hell, sometimes even if you&#8217;re not a newbie.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that to me, this really seems like more of a python issue than a Kamaelia one.  I mean, try installing <a href="http://www.die-offenbachs.de/eric/index.html">Eric</a> or <a href="http://pythonide.blogspot.com/">SPE</a> without some kind of package manager.  You&#8217;ll quickly learn the meaning of the words &#8220;dependency hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that said, I think that regardless of the platform that Kamaelia is on, it does aim to be a programming methodology that is easy to use for beginners.  And it does need to be able to overcome these problems if it ever intends to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>I was planning on making an &#8220;easy to use&#8221; package manager for installing WSGI software for end users to use.  If I do it properly, I may be able to make this be a solution for the problem that Gloria mentions.</p>

It is essentially an extension of Google&#8217;s OpenSocial that allows site owners to embed authentication and various other social apps in their webpage.  They give Ingrid Michaelson&#8217;s <a title="website" href="http://www.ingridmichaelson.com/" target="_blank">website</a> as an example of what FriendConnect can do.  Whatever the case, it looks pretty interesting.  And more importantly, it looks like something I would want to put into Kamaelia Publish.  I just signed up for a preview release of it.  We&#8217;ll see if I get in.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I decided to install Linux on my trusty old PowerMac G5.  Thus far, openSUSE is working pretty well aside from some pretty cryptic errors when trying to install my wireless card (and no, I still haven&#8217;t gotten those wireless drivers working yet!).  However, I&#8217;m beginning to become a linux convert.</p>
<p>First of all, I really like <a title="KDevelop" href="http://www.kdevelop.org/" target="_blank">KDevelop</a>.  It seems like a very clean and easy to use development environment.  I&#8217;ve been spoiled by Visual Studio&#8217;s IntelliSense, so not having that takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>In other news, I&#8217;m currently working on a Kamaelia component that I call a &#8220;WSGIline&#8221;.  Essentially, it&#8217;s a graphline that can act as a WSGI application object.  That is, at least as far as the user is concerned.  In reality, it&#8217;s a lot more than that though.</p>
<p>One thing that I would like for this component to do is to be able to set up several request handlers.  That is to say, if a request comes in while the graphline is working on another request, it will create a new graphline to handle it.  Thus, it isn&#8217;t going to be stuck handling one request at a time.</p>
<p>Lastly, my mentor (Michael Sparks) just posted to the BBC&#8217;s blog about GSoC &#8216;08.  Way to go Michael!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, what can I say KamConnect?  We had a nice little run there didn&#8217;t we?  But it was all a relationship of convenience.  I mean, I needed a project title and you were just so&#8230; available.  But really, I just want to be friends.  It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me.  There&#8217;s someone else, this other software title called Kamaelia Publish.</p>
<p>Joking aside, KamConnect was kind of a name that I threw on my project just to have one.  I think it&#8217;s time for something that has more of an air of simplicity and sophistication, thus the new title.  I had originally planned on making the title Press instead of Publish, but well, Kamaelia Press just sounds too much like a &#8220;me too&#8221; Kamaelia version of wordpress.</p>
<p>Secondly, I&#8217;ve been playing around with MoinMoin.  The software is definitely impressive.  But MoinMoin is a bit of a pain to install (granted I did do it the hard way instead of using my web host&#8217;s install script).  Another option that I&#8217;m beginning to toy around with is one that I had initially rejected.  Why not write my own script using Kamaelia?  By the time I get done modifying MoinMoin to do some of the extra stuff, I might as well just write my own script.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Just what the world needs, another CMS.&#8221;  But it turns out there is a bit of a need in this area.  I need something that has a minimum of dependencies (although Kamaelia is fine as I don&#8217;t really have any choice in whether or not to use it anyway).  Next, I would like something that lets me do templating.  My favored option is <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/" target="_blank">mako</a> as it seems to be the simplest and most lightweight, but I&#8217;m really open to suggestions.</p>
<p>And finally, I&#8217;ve set up a wiki for my project (although admittedly it&#8217;s a bit bare at the moment).  The wiki can be found <a href="http://wsgi.coderspalace.com/kcwiki/" target="_self">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, for my project, I&#8217;m going to have to use some kind of CMS that will be installed by default when the users install Descartes (the Web Server portion of my project).  There are three requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has to be easy to use.</li>
<li>It has to be lightweight and have a minimum of dependencies.</li>
<li>It has to use WSGI.</li>
<li>It has to use some kind of templating system (preferably Mako).</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus far, I haven&#8217;t really found anything that matches this.  MoinMoin and Cerenity are the most lightweight, but both are lacking a few features and will require some heavy modification.  Plone, well, is pretty much out of the question.</p>
<p>I am interested in Skeletonz CMS, but it looks to be a tad heavy on dependencies.  If nothing else, I can write my own, but that will definitely take more time.</p>
