This made it possible for me to arrive at a startling revelation at PyCon this year, one that significantly changed my perception of the Python community, and my view of my place in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always loved going to PyCon and working with people in the community.  But it wasn't until I heard David Goodger's opening remarks on Friday that it finally dawned on me how important Python is to many of its members as a community and circle of friends.  Or for that matter, how important it is to me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the back story:  In the early days of PyCon, in 2004, I heard that David couldn't come to the conference for lack of funds.  He'ld been laid off.  I sent an email to the docutils mailing list and within hours had enough pledges to pay for his travel and accommodations.  One anonymous donor gave over $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was more or less the last I thought of it until I heard David speak about it this year.  What he said was that he was not just out of work but also depressed and this show of support from the community ended up meaning a lot to him.  It was clear from talking about this with others afterwards that he's not alone in his perception of the community as very personal indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you're not the type to get teary eyed by such stories of unselfish giving from members of our far-flung community (and I admit I do), you can't argue with the sheer brilliance of this approach.  As an investment in our collective future, this gesture turned out to pay off handsomely.  As many of you may know, David has served as Director in the Python Software Foundation, where he has done a fantastic job as Secretary, and he has worked intensively this year as the PyCon Chairman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I've figured it out, and I am all the more confident of the health and vigor of Python.  The motivations run much deeper than I thought, as do the rewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also why I'm not much concerned about &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/2b6cb0e7245347be"&gt;some of the criticisms&lt;/a&gt; of this year's PyCon.  These things will be fixed next year, and we'll move on.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every community has its problems.  It's just a question of how (and whether) the community comes together to solve them.  Like the small rural town where I live, one that strongly resists 21st century corporate intrusions into our 19th century village, I have a feeling that the Python community is not going to be building a Walmart any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is useful to those that share my social denseness, or that it may inspire others to practice spontaneous kindness as a way to build community.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/2008/03/pycon-and-python-community.html' title='PyCon and the Python Community'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11408298&amp;postID=3799916649926585876' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/feeds/3799916649926585876/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/3799916649926585876'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11408298/posts/default/3799916649926585876'/><author><name>Stephan Deibel</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13291861266810695304</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11408298.post-1891089739330626639</id><published>2008-03-07T06:47:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-03-07T07:14:03.808-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Wing IDE 3.0.4 and 3.1 beta1 released</title><content type='html'>Wingware released two new versions of its Python IDE this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://wingware.com/downloads/wingide/3.0.4"&gt;Version 3.0.4&lt;/a&gt; is a bug fix release, most notable for reducing debugger overhead by about 50% per Python instruction executed.

To some extent the answer is that Python has a much bigger community of developers that worked on web frameworks starting much earlier in the history of the web. To another extent, it might be that Python and everything based on Python is perpetually (and to me frustratingly) under-hyped or under-promoted compared to just about everything else in the world of commercial and even open source software.

The goal is to let people know what the &lt;a href="http://python.org/psf"&gt;PSF&lt;/a&gt; does and, hopefully, to generate some additional support in the form of donations, sponsorships, and volunteer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why give to the PSF?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;1) The PSF keeps Python free.&lt;/span&gt; It does the grunt work to make sure that Python's open source license is legally valid. Unfortunately, it takes more than just slapping a license on some code to make open source. You also need to make sure that contributors to the project formally sign over the rights to the code that they provide. This is a pain in the butt, but it's important. The PSF takes care of this and related legal head aches, which cost some money and a lot of time to deal with. For some details on licensing, see the &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq"&gt;PSF License FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2) The PSF is giving grants.&lt;/span&gt;  This year a smallish initial &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/psf/grants/"&gt;grant program&lt;/a&gt; gave $40K to three out of more than 60 applicants. The grant program is designed to help in areas that the open source community cannot cover well. A great example of this is Jython, which has been falling behind Python in features. A grant called &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/psf/grants/Jython_PSF_Grant_Proposal.pdf"&gt;Moving Jython Forward (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; was was funded this year. Unfortunately, the available $40K was much too little money to fund enough of the proposals, and quite a few good ones went unfunded. With about 750,000 Python programmers in the world, it would take only $10 per year from 10%, or more realistically $100 per year from 1% to create a fantastic grants program to fund significant portions of Python's development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;3) The PSF funds other activities.&lt;/span&gt; Not all projects funded by the PSF exist in the context of the grants program. Some are projects that the PSF defines and makes possible through funding. One example is a project that aims to update both the framework behind &lt;a href="http://python.org/"&gt;python.org&lt;/a&gt; and the look and feel of the site.  Another that has not yet been funded would build a better framework for the &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/Jobs.html"&gt;Python Job Board&lt;/a&gt;, which due to increasing volume has become a burden to the volunteers that support it. Both are, clearly, very important resources for the Python community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;4) The PSF makes PyCon possible.&lt;/span&gt; The annual Python developers conference,&lt;a href="http://pycon.org/"&gt; PyCon&lt;/a&gt;, is 100% community run. But it wouldn't be possible without the PSF, which takes the responsibility for the fixed costs associated with the venue before enough registration money is collected to pay for them. So far the PSF has been able to make a modest income from each event, but there is never a guarantee that this will be the case, especially as the event continues to grow and a larger venue may become necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the PSF does a whole lot of good in the world of Python. If you benefit from Python, please consider giving back the community by volunteering and/or &lt;a href="http://python.org/psf/donations"&gt;donating to the PSF&lt;/a&gt;.  We can accept credit cards, checks, and payments made via PayPal.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/2005/03/case-for-python-software-foundation.html' title='The Case for the Python Software Foundation'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11408298&amp;postID=111095350284471432' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/feeds/111095350284471432/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/111095350284471432'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11408298/posts/default/111095350284471432'/><author><name>Stephan Deibel</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13291861266810695304</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11408298.post-111068665091261444</id><published>2005-03-12T18:38:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-03-13T18:34:27.566-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Python's Niche?</title><content type='html'>A few years back I started &lt;a href="http://pythonology.org/"&gt;pythonology.org&lt;/a&gt; as a way to try to help new users pick up Python, particularly when they needed material to convince management that Python is a good choice. Together with the launch of this partially neglected site, I created a now-inactive mailing list &lt;a href="http://pythonology.org/mailman/listinfo/marketing-python"&gt;marketing-python&lt;/a&gt;. Bold ambitions were announced, but not much happened in the context of "marketing" Python as you might market, say, Java or .NET with a boat load of vigorous hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consensus seemed to be that Python needs a "niche" like those that catapulted Perl and PHP to comparatively wild success. But Python is terrific for many things so it's hard to focus on one or another. With no killer app and no hefty marketing bank roll in sight, we were told that little open source Python could never succeed by herself in the mainstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here we are in 2005 and something curious has happened -- &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/09/24/39FErrdev_1.html?s=feature"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt; tells us that 14% of all programmers use Python, up 6% from the previous year. This almost doubles the number of Python programmers world-wide. Microsoft and Google are providing two out of three keynotes at the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt; conference. Many other big companies are using Python, more and more of them openly on mission critical projects (see for example, &lt;a href="http://wingware.com/python/success"&gt;Python Success Stories&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it seems Python is succeeding without any organized marketing effort from the community. Does this mean it has a niche after all? I think it does and it's really quite simple: In a world where more and more companies want to avoid proprietary traps, Python is the solution they are turning to. Python represents the only really viable, robust, scalable, and mature open source alternative to broad-based proprietary technologies like C# or Java. In fact, Python is a heck of a lot better than either of these heavy-weights, in some areas where its standard libraries and third party modules really shine (or theirs really suck). For examples, see &lt;a href="http://wingware.com/python"&gt;this overview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I'm right, I and my fellow dysfunctional marketeers can rest at last and enjoy the ride, because the push for technological freedom is - especially outside of the USA - a largely unstoppable force. And Python is, I can say with confidence, quite ready for the crush.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/2005/03/pythons-niche.html' title='Python&apos;s Niche?'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11408298&amp;postID=111068665091261444' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/feeds/111068665091261444/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://pythonology.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/111068665091261444'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/11408298/posts/default/111068665091261444'/><author><name>Stephan Deibel</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13291861266810695304</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry></feed>
