			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I find myself less interested in reviewing technical books than I was a couple of years ago, and I think I have figured out why.  I used to write a lot of code: for my job, for books I was working on, for open source projects, and occasionally for non-profits or friends.  I enjoyed it, and was always looking for new ideas or technologies that would make my life easier and my apps sparkle.</p>
<p>But that was then, and this is now.  Now, I write grant applications and curmudgeonly articles, not code.  My only involvement with the stuff I used to care so much about is steering student projects, and even that is getting harder to pull off&#8212;I&#8217;ve fallen so far out of touch with today&#8217;s technologies (and the details of the projects I am supposed to be supervising) that I embarrass myself through ignorance with ever-increasing frequency.</p>
<p>I tried for a while to change my reading material to match the change in my role.  Project management, software development processes, software architecture&#8212;I&#8217;ve read and reviewed a fair few books in these areas since 2005, but none of them have really stirred my soul.  That&#8217;s partly because &#8220;soft&#8221; topics are much harder to teach in print than technology, but also because deep down, my heart&#8217;s not in it.  I don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to be one of those slightly-out-of-touch managers I sneered at when I had one eyebrow dyed red and saw <em>Stop Making Sense</em> a dozen times in three months.  I want to build things, dammit: elegant, useful things that do their job so well nobody really notices they&#8217;re there.</p>
<p>So what should I do?  Find a job where I can get my hands into code again?  Resign myself to sitting on the beach and watching the young punks surf the waves I used to ride?  The first would be difficult: I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d add enough value to justify the salary I need to feed my mortgage without taking more time away from family than I&#8217;m willing to.  But the second rankles.  Cabinet makers and goldsmiths and other skilled artisans don&#8217;t have to give up their craft as they get older; why should I?</p>
<p>In thirty-five minutes, I&#8217;ll deliver my &#8220;HPC Considered Harmful&#8221; talk to HPCS&#8217;08 in Quebec City.  This time tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be back at my desk in Toronto, revising yet another grant application, and wishing that I really, truly understood <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>&#8217;s internals.  In between I&#8217;ll spend some time with my wife, and feed my daughter breakfast.  It&#8217;s a good life, really&#8212;I have so much more than I ever expected to.  But some time in the next few days I&#8217;m going to look at the books on my shelf and wish I was knee deep in something that would give me a reason to read one line by line and cover to cover.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At quarter after ten last night, in our pajamas, Sadie and I signed the papers to buy a new house.  (Well, new for us: it was built in the 1920s, and the previous owner lived in it for 51 years.)  This afternoon I picked up a check at the bank and handed it over to the real estate agent as a down payment.  It seemed like such a small piece of paper, considering everything that was riding on it&#8230; We take possession at the end of August; lots of renos to do (knob and tube wiring &#8212; yee hah), but we&#8217;re very excited.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last summer we organized several pizza lunches at which people from local companies, and faculty from the department, could chat with our intern students.  They were a lot of fun: the students learned a lot about possible future careers, and what they could be doing now to prep for them, while the guests left knowing more about what to expect from our graduates (and in some cases, which ones to pursue).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m organizing similar lunches this summer. If you&#8217;d like to chat with 15-20 talented undergrads for an hour or so, please let me know (gvwilson@cs.toronto.edu).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/csc49x/2008summer">summer interns</a> are three weeks in, and making great progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicole Allard (Eclipse Feature Diagram Plugin): isn&#8217;t blogging, so I don&#8217;t know.</li>
<li>Jeff Balogh (Dojo Form Editor): has been working with Nick Jamil on a new customizable ticketing system for <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a>, and has also <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/2008/05/31/soc-week-1-semi-random-thoughts">posted some thoughts</a> at the end of his first week working on a drag-and-drop form editor for Dojo. Misleading debugging tools&#8212;check, but SVN plus patches considered harmful? Hm&#8230; What he actually says is, &#8220;Dojo, like a lot of other projects, is still using svn. This is great for, um, somebody, but I think it&#8217;s more detrimental than good for open source projects.&#8221; He likes the GIT way of doing things (&#8221;send it to the list&#8221;).</li>
<li>Matthew Basset (Hackystat Visual Studio Plugin): gosh, isn&#8217;t it nice when <a href="http://mbasset.wordpress.com/2008/05/29/isnt-it-cool-how-sometimes-things-just-work/">everything just runs</a>&#8230;</li>
<li>Ming Chow and Wenbing Li (Flare Dataflow Editor): <a href="http://pipe3f.wordpress.com/2008/05/24/dragging-my-way-to-the-bank/">drag and drop</a>, drag and drop, it&#8217;s so much fun, we just can&#8217;t stop.</li>
<li>Geofrey Flores and Qi Yang (Eclipse Web-CAT Plugin): whoo boy, <a href="http://summerwebcat.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-eclipse/">isn&#8217;t WebObjects fun?</a>  And trying to get a compatible mix of versions of various packages?  Woo hoo&#8230;</li>
<li>Eran Henig (Python Web-CAT Back End): as above (the three students share a blog).  <a href="http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/">Web-CAT</a> now knows how to run Python programs; the next step is to teach it how to run them securely.</li>
<li>Nick Jamil (DrProject): has been <a href="http://nickjamil.livejournal.com/6837.html">blogging</a> several times a day about ideas, progress, and discoveries.  He&#8217;d be interested in hearing your thoughts on the <a href="http://nickjamil.livejournal.com/6042.html">database schema</a> for the new ticketing component.</li>
<li>Xuan Le (OS161 Visualization): is already <strike>building</strike> <a href="http://os161viz.blogspot.com/2008/05/week-3.html">debugging</a> a GUI for the os161 visualization tool.</li>
<li>Chris Maddison (PyGraphics): doesn&#8217;t appear to be blogging either, but his project partner, Hardeep Singh, has just started (see below).</li>
<li>Victoria Mui (Cytoscape Graph Layout): can now <a href="http://idea021.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/up-and-running/">debug Cytoscape plugins in Eclipse</a>.  Time to get back to graph layout&#8230;</li>
<li>Luke Petrolekas (Documentation/Testing): has converted the <a href="http://swc.scipy.org">Software CArpentry</a> notes to a <a href="http://swc.scipy.org/drp/swc/wiki/intro">wiki</a>.  There&#8217;s still lots to do (embedding images, tidying up the bibliography, etc.), but it&#8217;s a great start.</li>
<li>Daniel Servos (Moodle Data Visualization): came down to chat a week ago about what instructors would actually like to visualize, and is now working on a final design and figuring out <a href="http://hackerdan.com/programing/debugging-moodle/">how to debug</a> <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</a>.</li>
<li>Hardeep Singh (PyGraphics): has just <a href="http://www.theootz.com/blog/36-blog/48-fun-with-threads-and-wingide-plus-a-little-intro.html">started blogging</a>.</li>
<li>Dmitri Vassiliev (SlashID): is <a href="http://slashid.wordpress.com/2008/05/29/the-three-stooges/">running into landmines</a> all over the place.  As always, <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> and other toolkits are only as usable as they are debuggable&#8230;</li>
<li>Eva Wong (Hackystat Data Visualization): is <a href="http://iwa-wong.livejournal.com/1281.html">getting on top of Flash</a>, and starting to think about how to get data out of the <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/Hackystat/">Hackystat</a> sensorbase.</li>
<li>Joseph Yeung (OpenAFS Control Panel): really should <a href="http://openafsmmc.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/openafs-kerberos-best-pratices-workshop/">blog more often</a>&#8230;</li>
<li>Kosta Zabashta (DrProject Chat): has discovered that getting data out of IRC and into <a href="http://www.drproject.org">DrProject</a> is the easy part; the hard part is <a href="http://drprojectirc.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/drproject-chat-log-interface/">how to display it</a>.  Your comments would be welcome&#8230;</li>
<li>Qiyu Zhu (DrProject Admin): has been fixing bugs, and more recently talking to <a href="http://www.lizblankenship.com/">Liz Blankenship</a> (our <a href="http://season.openusability.org/">Season of Usability</a> intern, now based in Seattle) about <a href="http://qzdrproject.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/ui-ideas-for-managing-roles-and-capabilities/">a role editor</a> for DrProject.</li>
