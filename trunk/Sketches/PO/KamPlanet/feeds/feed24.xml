			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pyohio.org">PyOhio</a>, the first annual Python programming mini-conference for Ohio and surrounding areas will take place Saturday, July 26, in Columbus, Ohio. The conference is free of change and will include scheduled presentations, Lighting Talks and unconference-style Open Spaces.</p>
<p>PyOhio invites all interested people to present scheduled talks. All presentations are expected to last 40 minutes with a 10 minute question-and-answer period. PyOhio will accept abstracts covering any area of Python programming. A classroom area with computers will also be<br />
available for possible hands-on sessions.</p>
<p>All presentations proposals should submit abstracts no longer than 500 words in length. Abstracts must include the title, summary of the presentation, the expertise level targeted, and a brief description of the area of Python programming it relates to.</p>
<p>All proposals should be emailed to <cfp@pyohio.org> for review.</p>
<p>The submission deadline will be June 1, 2008. Accepted proposals will be notified by July 1.</p>
<p>If you have trouble submitting a proposal, or have specific questions about proposals please email Mat Kovach <matkovach@gmail.com> or call at 216-798-3397.

<p>With so many cool things included like Python, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and Google&#8217;s persistence backend a short blog post like this can&#8217;t possibly due it justice.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Complex code is hard to manage, hard to isolate and hard to unit test. For these reasons it is more difficult and costly to modify. In other words you should try to avoid complex code.</p>
<p>Many software metrics exist to measure the complexity of code. One such metric is  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a>. Cyclomatic complexity (CC) is the measure of linearly independent paths through a program. The algorithm was developed by Thomas McCabe back in the 1970s.</p>
<p>CC really measures the amount of branching in a suite of code. Suites with more than seven branches are considered suboptimal and should be looked at for refactoring. The number seven was chosen because it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">believed</a> to be the average number of things a human being can concurrently hold in their head. CC is well covered on the internet so if you want to know more <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cyclomatic+complexity">Google</a> it.</p>
<p>I implemented the CC algorithm using a very simple <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/node884.html">AST</a> visitor. A CC number is calculated for each Module, Class, Method and Function in a file. The program currently calculates, but does not print the results for nested classes or nested functions.</p>
<p><b>Metric Frenzy</b><br />
Use metrics as a guide to show where there may be a need for refactoring. Don&#8217;t take them too seriously. Just because the complexity number is slightly above optimal doesn&#8217;t mean the code sucks. Metrics are not the definitive answer on code quality. So take them with a grain of salt.</p>
<p><b>Getting The Code</b><br />
The program and unit tests are available in my <a href="http://svn.traceback.org/python/cyclic_complexity">Subversion repository</a>. Just download the files into any directory on your system. You will need at least pygenie.py and cc.py.</p>
<p>I am probably going to create a new home on Google code for this stuff. It will be announced in a follow up post.</p>
<p><b>Running The Program</b><br />
The program expects one or more Python filenames or fully qualified module names to be passed in on the command line. For example:<br />
<i>./pygenie.py complexity mycode.py</i><br />
- or -<br />
<i>./pygenie.py complexity mycode.py dir0/dir1/mod.py</i><br />
- or -<br />
<i>./pygenie.py complexity dir0.dir1.mod</i></p>
<p>Running the program will print the results to standard output. This is a proof of concept and not a polished application so don&#8217;t expect real fancy output.</p>
<p><b>Interpreting The Results</b><br />
The output is a table of three columns: suite type, suite name and the complexity number. The suit type could have the following values: X for a module, F for a function, C for a class and M for a method. The suite name is the fully qualified name of a suite. The complexity number is just a simple integer representing the suite&#8217;s complexity. The rows are sorted by the complexity number in descending order.</p>
<p>Only things that have a high complexity number are shown by default. If you want to see all of the complexity values you can use the &#8211;verbose option. For example:<br />
<i>./pygenie.py complexity &#8211;verbose dir0.dir1.mod</i></p>
<p>Here is an example of running the cc.py code throught itself:</p>
<pre>
dstanek% ./pygenie.py complexity example.py
Module: example
Complexity Chart:
type name                             complexity
M    AClass.runtests                  28
F    fall_down                        10
F    run_away                         9
X    cc                               8
M    BClass.dosomething               8
F    duck_and_cover                   8
</pre>
<p>Code that is not shown because its complexity number is seven or less in not proven to be good. The design may be faulty, variables obfuscated or many other things.</p>
<p><b>Closing Thoughts</b><br />
It is good practice to try to keep the complexity of code to a minimum. Code with a low complexity number is less risky to change and easier to test. This should not be the only way to judge your code, just a supplement.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Python core team is <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/bazaar/">experimenting</a> with distributed version control. Python 2.5, 2.6 and 3.0 branches are now available under <a href="http://www.bazaar-vcs.org">Bazaar</a>. The Bazaar master is synced periodically from Subversion and may be slightly behind.</p>
<p>After the initial <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-March/077944.html">announcement</a> there was some debate about which VCS to use. It was made clear that this is an experiment. No decision has been made about switching away from Subversion. This is more about experimenting with the distributed workflow. If it turns out that distributed VCS is the way to go then there would be open discussion about which system to use.</p>
<p>There is also an unofficial <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> repository. Antoine Pitrou set it up as an alternative to Bazaar. For more information read the <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-March/077983.html">announcement</a> on the dev-python thread.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every Monday I&#8217;ll be describing a software design pattern and providing an implementation in Python. I&#8217;ll focus on mapping the pattern&#8217;s intent into idiomatic Python. Email me or leave a comment if you are interested in seeing a specific pattern. I&#8217;ll start out with some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612?tag=davistansdigr-20&#038;camp=0&#038;creative=0&#038;linkCode=as1&#038;creativeASIN=0201633612&#038;adid=18PYQKHMYYTFB423KYYE&#038;">GoF patterns</a> and then work toward the more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321127420?tag=davistansdigr-20&#038;camp=0&#038;creative=0&#038;linkCode=as1&#038;creativeASIN=0321127420&#038;adid=0B6P6P5E0KNN2EGKT8F6&#038;">enterprisey</a> ones.<br />
<a id="more-62"></a></p>
<p><b>What are design patterns?</b><br />
Certain problems come up over and over again when designing software. Things like localizing the creation of objects and wrapping APIs seem to come up in most projects I have worked on. Design patterns are elegant and extensible solutions to these and other software design problems. A pattern is not a complete design. It is advice for dealing with parts of your design. It describes a set of principles and the situations where they apply. A real design would likely consist of many patterns.</p>
<p>Patterns are discovered, not invented, by finding similar solutions in a wide variety of software systems. This ensures that they are true patterns and not a one-off solutions. This also means that the solutions are battle tested. You are not the first one to use them.</p>
<p><b>Do you need to know patterns?</b><br />
They are very important when building large systems. Using patterns will relieve you from having to rediscover solutions to problems that others have already solved. Systems built using patterns are also easier to maintain, because developers familiar with patterns will have less of a learning curve.</p>
<p>Having a firm understanding of patterns will make your designs better. Think of patterns as lessons from master software designers. They have already taken the time to solve this problem by looking at many alternatives. This is the best solution they could come up with.</p>
<p><b>Why is this different from the countless patterns books?</b><br />
Most modern pattern books use Java in their examples. The Java implementation can sometimes hide the pattern&#8217;s intent especially if you&#8217;re not a Java programmer. The implementation may look dramatically different in other languages. So if you&#8217;re like me and you use Python, the examples are almost worthless.</p>
<p>While translating the examples directly into Python is possible I wouldn&#8217;t suggest it. The resulting code would probably not be Pythonic and would instead stink of Java. We can do better than that.</p>
<p><b>More Information</b><br />
Use <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, it is your friends. The discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)">Wikipedia</a> is pretty good and the <a hfer="http://hillside.net/patterns/">Hillside.net Patterns Library</a> has a large amount of good information.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of daily life I see a ton of Python code. Between the code at work and all of the open source projects I watch I&#8217;m surprised my eyes don&#8217;t bleed. Over the years my style has changed dramatically. I guess you could say I am getting more Pythonic. Looking back at old code sometimes just make me feel ill. I know better now.<br />
<a id="more-55"></a></p>
<p>There was a project that I worked on where we wanted to ensure all attributes were typed properly. (No comments about this - it&#8217;s not the point of the post) To do this we used an evil combination of Hungarian notation and __setattr__ magic. An example class looks something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Data(object):

    def __init__(self, strX='', fltY=0.0, intZ=0):
        self.strX = strX
        self.fltY = fltY
        self.intZ = intZ

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if name.startswith('int'):
            object.__setattr__(self, name, int(value))
        elif name.startswith('flt'):
            object.__setattr__(self, name, float(value))
        elif name.startswith('str'):
            object.__setattr__(self, name, str(value))
        else:
            object.__setattr__(self, name, value)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As ugly as it is it actually works. All attributes are forced to a type based off of their name. I know the __setattr__ is rather slow, but I never really gave it a second thought even thought I periodically see this code. This weekend a neuron misfired and I had an idea. So I gave this a whirl:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
class TypedAttr(object):

    def __init__(self, _type, value):
        self._type = _type
        self._default = self._value = value

    def __get__(self, obj, _type):
        return self._value

    def __set__(self, obj, value):
        self._value = self._type(value)

    def __delete__(self, obj):
        self._value = self._default

class Data(object):
    strX = TypedAttr(str, '')
    fltY = TypedAttr(float, 0.0)
    intZ = TypedAttr(int, 0)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This Data class is must cleaner. The TypedAttr can be defined in another module making this code much smaller and more declarative.</p>
<p>The descriptor approach out performs the __getattr__. My tests were using the timeit module in Python 2.5. Running the old way gave me about 25 usec and the new way was 11 usec.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll suggest the change <img src='http://www.traceback.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We finally did it! This past Saturday we actually sprinted. Our goal is to build an open source equivalent of <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> &#8212; affectionately known as <a href="http://shindig.clepy.org">Shindig</a>. This software is a replacement for the overly complicated <a href="http://www.plone.org">Plone</a> instance I have running <a href="http://www.clepy.org">clepy.org</a>.</p>
<p>Even though we didn&#8217;t a whole lot of progress we learned some useful lessons. We had some minor technical difficulties like not everyone having a working wireless connection. Those issues are easy to overcome. The lessons I took to heart were more about timeliness and preparation. I was guilty of being an hour late and many people didn&#8217;t have the necessary stuff installed. No big deal, we&#8217;ll get better.</p>
<p>All in all I had fun. Drinking beer and writing code with my peers. The miscellaneous conversations about technology didn&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk more about the sprint at the <a href="http://clepy.org/meetings/2007_05_07_mtg_details">next meeting</a>, but I think we&#8217;ll keep having them. It seems that the best time will be the first or second Saturday after each meeting. Also it seems that starting a little later may be a good idea.
