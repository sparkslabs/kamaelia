* Security issues: check that all the possible html values are really escaped
* Caching information: if a server is down while the KamPlanet is running, the 
  information previously published and gathered by KamPlanet is lost, and it 
  shouldn't.
* Error handling: (manually or automatically) test what happens if servers are 
  down, and cross-component problems in general.
