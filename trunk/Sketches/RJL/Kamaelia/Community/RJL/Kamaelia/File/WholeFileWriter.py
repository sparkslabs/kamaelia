Whole File Writer
=======================

This component accepts file creation jobs and signals the completion of each
jobs. Creation jobs consist of a list [ filename, contents ] added to "inbox".
Completion signals consist of the string "done" being sent to "outbox".

All jobs are processed sequentially.
