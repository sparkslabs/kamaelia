=============================
Shutdown the Selector service
=============================

StopSelector asks the Selector service to shutdown; either immediately, or when
triggered by anything being sent to any of its inboxes.



Example Usage
-------------

Receive data from myserver.com port 1500, save it to a file, then finish::
    
    Pipeline( TCPClient("myserver.com",1500),
              SimpleFileWriter("received_data"),
              StopSelector(),
            ).run()



Behaviour
---------

At initialisation specify whether StopSelector should wait to be triggered or
act immediately. The default behaviour is to act immediately
(waitForTriger=False).

If asked, StopSelector will wait for anything to be sent to its "inbox" or
"control" inboxes. It will then immediately ask the Selector service to
shutdown, and immediately terminate.

Otherwise, StopSelector will do this as soon as it is activated, and will then
immediately terminate.

If it was triggered by a message being sent to the "control" inbox then this
will be sent on our of the "signal" outbox just before termination. Otherwise a
producerFinished message will be sent on just before termination.
