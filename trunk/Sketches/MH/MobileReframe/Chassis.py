=======================================================
Inbox size limiting Pipelines, Graphlines and Carousels
=======================================================

Extended versions of Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline, Kamaelia.Chassis.Graphline and
Kamaelia.Chassis.Carousel that add the ability to specify size limits for
inboxes of components.



Example Usages
--------------

A pipeline with inbox size limits on 3 of the components' "inbox" inboxes::

    Pipeline( 5,  MyComponent(),      # 'inbox' inbox limited to 5 items
              2,  MyComponent(),      # 'inbox' inbox limited to 2 items
                  MyComponent(),      # 'inbox' inbox unlimited
              28, MyComponent()       # 'inbox' inbox limited to 28 items
            )

A graphline where component 'A' has a size limit of 5 on its "inbox" inbox; and
component 'C' has a size limit of 17 on its "control" inbox::

    Graphline( A = MyComponent(),
               B = MyComponent(),
               C = MyComponent(),
               linkages = { ... },
               boxsizes = {
                   ("A","inbox") : 5,
                   ("C","control") : 17
               }
             )

A Carousel, where the child component will have a size limit of 5 on its "inbox"
inbox::

    Carousel( MyComponent(), boxsize=5 )

Decoding a Dirac video file and saving each frame in a separate file::

    Pipeline(
        RateControlledFileReader("video.dirac", ... ),
        DiracDecoder(),
        TagWithSequenceNumber(),
        InboxControlledCarousel(
            lambda (seqnum, frame) :
                Pipeline( OneShot(frame),
                          FrameToYUV4MPEG(),
                          SimpleFileWriter("%08d.yuv4mpeg" % seqnum),
                        )
            ),
        )


More details
------------

The behaviour of these three components/prefabs is identical to their original
counterparts (Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline, Kamaelia.Chassis.Graphline and
Kamaelia.Chassis.Carousel).

*For Pipelines*, if you want to size limit the "inbox" inbox of a particular
component in the pipeline, then put the size limit as an integer before it.
Any component without an integer before it is left with the default of an
unlimited "inbox" inbox.

The behaviour therefore reduces back to be identical to that of the normal
Pipeline component.

*For Graphlines*, if you want to size limit particular inboxes, supply the
"boxsizes" argument with a dictionary that maps (componentName, boxName) keys
to the size limit for that box.

Again, if you don't specify a "boxsizes" argument, then behaviour is identical
to that of the normal Graphline component.

*For Carousels*, if you want a size limit on the "inbox" inbox of the child
component (created by the factory function), then specify it using the
"boxsizes" argument.

Again, if you don't specify a "boxsizes" argument, then behaviour is identical
to that of the normal Carousel component.

*InboxControlledCarousel* behaves identically to Carousel.

The "inbox" inbox is equivalent to the "next" inbox of Carousel.
The "data_inbox" inbox is equivalent to the "inbox" inbox of Carousel.
