 It is retired because it's contents is now part of the main code base.

 If you wanted it for:  RateControlledReadFileAdapter
 This is now in: Kamaelia.File.Reading as RateControlledFileReader

 If you wanted it for: ReadFileAdapter_Carousel
 This is now in: Kamaelia.File.Reading as ReusableFileReader

 If you wanted it for: RateControlledReadFileAdapter_Carousel
 This is now in: Kamaelia.File.Reading as RateControlledReusableFileReader

 If you wanted it for: JoinChooserToCarousel
 This is now in: Kamaelia.Chassis.Prefab as JoinChooserToCarousel

 If you wanted it for: FixedRate_ReadFileAdapter_Carousel
 This is now in: Kamaelia.File.Reading as FixedRateControlledReusableFileReader

 This file now deliberately exits to encourage you to fix your code :-)
 (Hopefully contains enough info to help you fix it)
