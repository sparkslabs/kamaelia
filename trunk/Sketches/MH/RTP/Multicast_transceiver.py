Simple multicast transceiver
============================

A simple component for transmitting and receiving multicast packets.

Remember that multicast is an unreliable connection - packets may be lost,
duplicated or reordered.



Example Usage
-------------

Send a file to, and receive data from multicast group address 1.2.3.4 on
port 1000 with no guarantees of reliability, integrity or packet ordering::

    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader("myfile", rate=100000),
              Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 0, "1.2.3.4", 1000),
            ).activate()

    Pipeline( Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 1000, "1.2.3.4", 0)
              ConsoleEchoer()
            ).activate()

Or::
    
    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader("myfile", rate=100000),
              Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 1000, "1.2.3.4", 1000),
              ConsoleEchoer()
            ).activate()

The data emitted by Multicast_transciever (and displayed by ConsoleEchoer) is of
the form (source_address, data).



Behaviour
---------

Data sent to the component's "inbox" inbox is sent to the multicast group.

Data received from the multicast group is emitted as a tuple:
(source_addr, data) where data is a string of the received data.

This component will terminate if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished
message is sent to its "control" inbox. This message is forwarded onto the CSA.
Multicast_transceiver will then wait for the CSA to terminate. It then sends its
own shutdownMicroprocess message out of the "signal" outbox.

Multicast groups do not 'shut down', so this component will not usually emit any
signals on its "signal" outbox. However if, for some reason, there is a socket
error, a shutdownMicroprocess message will be sent out the "signal" outbox and
this component will then immediately terminate.



Why a transciever component?
----------------------------

Listens for packets in the given multicast group. Any data received is
sent to the receiver's outbox. The logic here is likely to be not quite
ideal. When complete though, this will be preferable over the sender and
receiver components since it models what multicast really is rather than
what people tend to think it is.




How does it work?
-----------------

Multicast_transceiver opens a socket connection to the specified server on the
specified port. Data received over the connection appears at the component's
"outbox" outbox as strings. Data can be sent as strings by sending it to the
"inbox" inbox.

An optional delay (between component activation and attempting to connect) can
be specified. The default is no delay.

It creates a ConnectedSocketAdapter (CSA) to handle the socket connection and
registers it with a selectorComponent so it is notified of incoming data. The
selectorComponent is obtained by calling
selectorComponent.getSelectorService(...) to look it up with the local
Coordinating Assistant Tracker (CAT).

Multicast_transceiver wires itself to the "CreatorFeedback" outbox of the CSA.
It also wires its "inbox" inbox to pass data straight through to the CSA's
"inbox" inbox, and its "outbox" outbox to pass through data from the CSA's
"outbox" outbox.

Socket errors (after the connection has been successfully established) may be
sent to the "signal" outbox.

This component will terminate if the CSA sends a socketShutdown message to its
"CreatorFeedback" outbox.

This component will terminate if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished
message is sent to its "control" inbox. This message is forwarded onto the CSA.
Multicast_transceiver will then wait for the CSA to terminate. It then sends its
own shutdownMicroprocess message out of the "signal" outbox.
