#
# This could do with rewriting to utilise components such as PlugSplitter and/or
# Backplane.
#
# It could moved into Kamaelia/Examples - its basically a kind of plug server
# where a data source connects in, and multiple clients connect. If the data
# source goes down, teh clients don't notice, so it kinda "normalises" the
# connection from the clients' perspective.
#
# Of course, there is code specifically to do with subtitle data processing.
