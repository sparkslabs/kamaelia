Kamaelia: VERSION
=================

This is an interim release bundle. These are now going to be built monthly,
and each may mature into a full release.

A release bundle is indicated by ending with a version number ending .0 They
are typically built near the end of the month.

Generally /trunk (which these are built off) is kept stable, meaning this
tar ball should be in a good state, but you may find a bug. If you do,
please report it with ways of reproducing it to the kamaelia mailing list

Guide to directories:

    * Axon - Contains Kamaelia's core. You can use this by itself in your
      code if you like. Necessary to use Kamaelia & Kamaelia based
      applications.

      Axon's core reference is here:
        * http://www.kamaelia.org/Docs/Axon/Axon

    * Kamaelia - the big ol' bucket of components. They do all sorts of
      things in here, ranging from audio playback, topology visualisers,
      markov chains, network servers, etc. 

      Components are documented hee:
        * http://www.kamaelia.org/Components

    * Bindings - a collection of python bindings for a variety of different
      libraries. Not necessary for use of Kamaelia, but some components may
      require some bindings. (DVB stuff requiring DVB, Vorbis requiring
      vorbis bindings, etc)

    * Apps - A collection of Kamaelia based applications. These assist with
      a variety of tasks - from greylisting through to ER Modelling and
      batch video transcoding. They also serve as larger examples showing
      how applications can be builts and structured.
