Linkages
========

Components only have input & output boxes. For data to get from a producer
(eg a file reader) to a consumer (eg an encryption component) then the output
of one component, the source component, must be linked to the input of
another component, the sink component.

* linkage objects are handles describing a linkage from one postbox to another
* Axon.Postoffice.postoffice creates and destroys linkages

All components have a postoffice object, this performs the creation and
destruction of linkages. Ask it for a linkage between inboxes and outboxes and
a linkage object is returned as a handle describing the linkage. When a message
is sent to an outbox, it is immediately delivered along linkage(s) to the
destination inbox.

This is *not* the usual technique for software messaging. Normally you create
messages, addressed to something specific, and then the message handler delivers
them.

However the method of communication used here is the norm for *hardware* systems,
and generally results in very pluggable components - the aim of this system,
hence this design approach rather than the normal. This method of
communication is also the norm for one form of software system - unix shell
scripting - something that has shown itself time and again to be used in ways
the inventors of programs/components never envisioned.
