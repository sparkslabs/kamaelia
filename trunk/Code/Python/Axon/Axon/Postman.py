"""Kamaelia Concurrency Component Framework.

POSTMAN

A postman is a microprocess that knows about linkages, and components,
and hence runs concurrently to your components. It can have a number of
components & linkages registered with it.

Periodically it checks the sources of the linkages it knows about for
messages. If it finds some messages it checks where to deliver them to by
looking at the sink of the linkage. Assuming it finds a destination to deliver to, the
postmans then delivers the messages to the inbox of the assigned destination
component.

   !!!! It is highly possible this could result in a race hazard if message queues
   !!!! can grow faster than the postman can deliver them. As a result the system
   !!!! provides Synchronised Boxes as well which have a maximum, enforced
   !!!! capacity which works to prevent this issue - at the expense of extra logic
