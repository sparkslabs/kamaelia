"""Kamaelia Concurrency Component Framework.

SCHEDULER

You provide the scheduler with microthreads of microprocesses,
and it runs them, clean and simple. This is usually handled by the component
system via returning a newComponent value. An alternative is to call the
component's activate method.

It also has a slow motion mode designed to help with debugging & testing.

      times again. Note : the delay is between the start points of cycles, and not
      between the start and end points of cycles. The delay is NOT 100% accurate
      nor guaranteed and can be extended by threads that take too long to;
      complete. (Think of it as a "hello world" of soft-real time scheduling)
