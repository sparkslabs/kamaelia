====================
Simple Echo Protocol
====================

A simple protocol component that echoes back anything sent to it.

It simply copies its input to its output.



Example Usage
-------------

A simple server that accepts connections on port 1501, echoing back anything sent
to it::

    >>> SimpleServer(protocol=EchoProtocol, port=1501).run()

On a unix/linux client::

    > telnet <server ip> 1501
    Trying <server ip>...
    Connected to <server ip>...
    hello world, this will be echoed back when I press return (newline)
    hello world, this will be echoed back when I press return (newline)
    oooh, thats nice!
    oooh, thats nice!



How does it work?
-----------------

The component receives data on its "inbox" inbox and immediately copies it to
its "outbox" outbox.

If a producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess message is received on its
"control" inbox, the component sends a producerFinished message to its "signal"
outbox and terminates.

class EchoProtocol(component):
   """\
   EchoProtocol() -> new EchoProtocol component

   Simple component that copies anything sent to its "inbox" inbox to its "outbox"
   outbox.
   """

   def __init__(self,**argd):
      """x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature"""
      super(EchoProtocol, self).__init__(**argd) # Accept default in/outboxes

         #print "We should probably do something with it now? :-)"

         self.send(data,"outbox")
         
      return self.shutdown()

   def shutdown(self):
       """Return 0 if a shutdown message is received, else return 1."""
       while self.dataReady("control"):
           msg=self.recv("control")
           if isinstance(msg,producerFinished) or isinstance(msg,shutdownMicroprocess):
