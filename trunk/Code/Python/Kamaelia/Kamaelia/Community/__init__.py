"""
Kamaelia.Community is the area of the released Kamaelia namespace owned
by the community. We have a packaging mechanism which simplifies the process
of adding your code here. The sub-name spaces are owned by specific individuals.
If you want a namespace, let use know and we'll reserve it for you in here.

The naming here follows directories already created in /Sketches in the
non-released namespace.
