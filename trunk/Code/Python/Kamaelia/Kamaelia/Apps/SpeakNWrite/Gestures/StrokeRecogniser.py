# single character handwriting recognition

# character set similar to that used by graffiti 2 - many characters are
# single stroke; normal letter shapes. Some are multi stroke.
# 
# in this, the diagnostic output is the interpretation of the single stroke only
# grammar rules are post-applied to generate multi-stroke characters (by sending
# a backspace to undo the previous character, and writing a new one instead)
