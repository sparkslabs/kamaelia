Pygame Button Widget
====================

A button widget for pygame display surfaces. Sends a message when clicked.

Uses the Pygame Display service.



Example Usage
-------------
Three buttons that output messages to the console::
    
    button1 = Button(caption="Press SPACE or click",key=K_SPACE).activate()
    button2 = Button(caption="Reverse colours",fgcolour=(255,255,255),bgcolour=(0,0,0)).activate()
    button3 = Button(caption="Mary...",msg="Mary had a little lamb", position=(200,100)).activate()
    
    ce = ConsoleEchoer().activate()
    button1.link( (button1,"outbox"), (ce,"inbox") )
    button2.link( (button2,"outbox"), (ce,"inbox") )
    button3.link( (button3,"outbox"), (ce,"inbox") )
    


How does it work?
-----------------

The component requests a display surface from the Pygame Display service
component. This is used as the surface of the button. It also binds event
listeners to the service, as appropriate.

Arguments to the constructor configure the appearance and behaviour of the
button component:

- If an output "msg" is not specified, the default is a tuple ("CLICK", id) where
  id is the self.id attribute of the component.

- A pygame keycode can be specified that will also trigger the button as if it
  had been clicked

- you can set the text label, colour, margin size and position of the button

- the button can have a transparent background

- you can specify a size as width,height. If specified, the margin size is
  ignored and the text label will be centred within the button

If a producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess message is received on its
"control" inbox. It is passed on out of its "signal" outbox and the component
terminates.

Upon termination, this component does *not* unbind itself from the Pygame Display
service. It does not deregister event handlers and does not relinquish the
display surface it requested.
