===============================
On Demand/Wakeable Introspector
===============================

This component grabs a list of all running/runnable components whenever it
receives a message on its inbox "inbox". This list is then sorted, and
noted to a logfile.



Example Usage
-------------

This component is intended to be used with PeriodicWakeup, as follows::

    Pipeline(
         PeriodicWakeup(interval=20),
         WakeableIntrospector(logfile="/tmp/trace"),
    )



How does it work?
-----------------

This component uses the fact that we can ask the scheduler for a list of
running componenents, takes this, sorts it and dumps the result to a
logfile.

It then sits quietly waking for a message (any message) on the inbox "inbox".



Termination
-----------

This component will shutdown if any message is sent to its control inbox.


TODO
----

In retrospect, it may've been nicer to split the introspection from the
logging. Better termination/shutdown would be a good idea.
