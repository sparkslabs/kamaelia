This is a simple WSGI way of serving static content.  If you use it with Kamaelia's
WSGI handler, it runs in its own thread so there's no need to worry about non-blocking
IO!

This is really just a wrapper around Static Cling by Luke Arno that will expand
the user directory (ex:  ~/foo will be expanded into /home/jason/foo)

This application requires the following custom environ entries:

* kp.static_path:  The path to pull static data from.  For example if http://foo.com/static/index.html
would pull the file ~/www/index.html if kp.static_path is ~/www
* kp.index_file:  The file to open if no file is specified.  For example, http://foo.com/static
would translate into http://foo.com/static/index.html if kp.index_file is 'index.html'.
