This is a wrapper around Paste Deploy's loadapp function.  It is useful if you would
rather use Paste Deploy's configuration file URL routing instead of the URL handling
built into Kamaelia.Experimental.Wsgi.Factory or if you would like to serve Pylons
apps.

Custom environ entries
-----------------------

This app requires the following custom environ variables:

* kp.paste_source:  A string to be passed to loadapp.  Is a URI for either a config
file or egg.  See http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/#basic-usage for more info.

Dependencies
-------------

This application requires Paste Deploy (obviously).
"""

from paste.deploy import loadapp
import os

__app_objs__ = {}

def application(environ, start_response):
    if __app_objs__.get(environ['kp.paste_source']):
        app = __app_objs__[environ['kp.paste_source']]
    else:
        app = loadapp(environ['kp.paste_source'])
        
    return app(environ, start_response)
