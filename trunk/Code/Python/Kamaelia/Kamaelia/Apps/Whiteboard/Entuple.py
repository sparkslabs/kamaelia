Entuple data
============

Receives data on its "inbox" inbox; wraps that data inside a tuple, and outputs
that tuple from its "outbox" outbox.



Example Usage
-------------
Taking console input and sandwiching it in a tuple between the strings
("You" and "said") and ("just" and now")::
    
    Pipeline( ConsoleReader(),
              Entuple(prefix=["You","said"], postfix=["just","now"]),
              ConsoleEchoer(),
            ).run()

At runtime::
    >>> Hello there!
    ('You', 'said', 'Hello there!', 'just', 'now')



How does it work?
-----------------

At initialisation specify a list of items to be placed at the front (prefix) and
back (postfix) of the tuples that are output.

When an item of data is received at the "inbox" inbox; it is placed inside a
tuple, after the prefixes and before the postfixes. It is then immediately sent
out of the "outbox" outbox.

For example: if the prefix is [1,2,3] and the postfix is ['a','b'] and the item
of data that arrives is 'flurble' then (1,2,3,'flurble','a','b') will be sent to
the "outbox" outbox.

If Entuple receives a shutdownMicroprocess message on its "control" inbox, it
will pass it on out of the "signal" outbox. The component will then terminate.
