This file contains some utility classes which are used by both the client and
server components of the port tester application.

# NOTE: The naming of this *file* is by MPS. It follows the argument that a
# large variety of components relating to "plumbing" (including data source,
# graphline, pipeline, etc) actually relate to a Domain Specific Language
# relating to parallel systems, and how to work with them. This component is
# clearly considered an output. The name of this file could very well change
# before merge.

    safe, so do not access it until the component has shutdown.
