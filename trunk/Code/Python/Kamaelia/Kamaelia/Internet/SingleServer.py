"""
This is a simpler server than the SimpleServer component. Specifically it
only allows a single connection to occur at a time. Any data received on that
connection is sent to the component's outbox, and any data received on its
inbox is sent to the connection.
When a connection closes, it sends a producerFinished signal.

TODO:
If there is already a connection, then any new connections are shutdown. It would
be better if they weren't accepted in the first place, but that requires changes to
TCPServer.

FastRestartSingleServer is exactly the same as SingleServer, expect its default is
to set appropriate socket options to allow the server to restart instantly. This isn't
the traditional default because in kamaelia we prefer to follow the defaults of the
OS, rather than local defaults.
