Talking to network sockets
==========================

A Connected Socket Adapter (CSA) component talks to a network server socket.
Data is sent to and received from the socket via this component's inboxes and
outboxes. A CSA is effectively a wrapper for a socket.

Most components should not need to create CSAs themselves. Instead, use
components such as TCPClient to make an outgoing connection, or TCPServer or
SimpleServer to be a server that responds to incoming connections.



Example Usage
-------------
See source code for TCPClient to see how Connected Socket Adapters can be used.


See also
--------
- TCPClient     -- for making a connection to a server
- TCPServer     -- 
- SimpleServer  -- a prefab chassis for building a server


How does it work?
-----------------
A CSA is usually created either by a component such as TCPClient that wants to
establish a connection to a server; or by a primary listener socket - a
component acting as a server - listening for incoming connections from clients.

The socket should be set up and passed to the constructor to make the CSA.

Incoming data, read by the CSA, is sent out of its "outbox" outbox as strings
containing the received binary data. Send data by sending it, as strings, to
the "DataSend" outbox.

The CSA expects to be wired to a component that will notify it when new data
has arrived at its socket (by sending an Axon.Ipc.status message to its
"DataReady" inbox. This is to allow the CSA to sleep rather than busy-wait or
blocking when waiting for new data to arrive. Typically this is the Selector
component.

This component will terminate (and close its socket) if it receives a
producerFinished message on its "control" inbox.

When this component terminates, it sends a socketShutdown(socket) message out of
its "FactoryFeedback" outbox and a shutdownCSA((selfCSA,self.socket)) message
out of its "signal" outbox.

The message sent to "FactoryFeedback" is to notify the original creator that
the socket is now closed and that this component should be unwired.

The message sent to the "signal" outbox serves to notify any other component
involved - such as the one feeding notifications to the "DataReady" inbox (eg.
the Selector component).
