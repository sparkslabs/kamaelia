Resampling Audio using PyMedia
==============================

This component resamples raw audio data sent to its "inbox" inbox, changing it
to a different sample rate and/or number of channels, and outputting it from its
"outbox" outbox. It does this using the pymedia library.



Example Usage
-------------

Capturing CD quality audio and playing it at telephone quality (8KHz, mono)::
    
    Pipeline( Input(sample_rate=44100, channels=2, format="S16_LE"),
              Resample(44100, 2, 8000, 1),
              Output(sample_rate=8000, channels=1, format="S16_LE"),
            ).run()



How does it work?
-----------------

Resample uses the PyMedia library to change the sample rate and/or number of
channels of audio.

Send raw binary audio data strings to its "inbox" inbox. It will be resampled
and the resulting raw binary audio data strings are sent out of its "outbox"
outbox.

Note that resampling can change the sample rate or number of channels, but *not*
the sample format. The sample format output will be the same as the input.

Resampling is done by duplicating/dropping samples. No interpolation takes
place. This is therefore not a good quality resample, but it is reasonably fast.

This component will terminate if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished
message is sent to the "control" inbox. The message will be forwarded on out of
the "signal" outbox just before termination.
