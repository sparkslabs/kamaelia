Comparing two data sources
==========================

The Comparator component tests two incoming streams to see if the items they
contain match (pass an equality test).



Example Usage
-------------
Compares contents of two files and prints "MISMATCH!" whenever one is found::

    class DetectFalse(component):
        def main(self):
            while 1:
                yield 1
                if self.dataReady("inbox"):
                    if not self.recv("inbox"):
                        print "MISMATCH!"

    Graphline( file1   = RateControlledFileReader(filename="file 1", ...),
               file2   = RateControlledFileReader(filename="file 2", ...),
               compare = Comparator(),
               fdetect = DetectFalse(),
               output  = ConsoleEchoer(),
               linkages = {
                   ("file1","outbox") : ("compare","inA"),
                   ("file2","outbox") : ("compare","inB"),
                   ("compare", "outbox") : ("fdetect", "inbox"),
                   ("fdetect", "outbox") : ("output", "inbox"),
               },
             ).run()



How does it work?
-----------------

The component simply waits until there is data ready on both its "inA" and "inB"
inboxes, then takes an item from each and compares them. The result of the
comparison is sent to the "outbox" outbox.

If data is available at neither, or only one, of the two inboxes, then the
component will wait indefinitely until data is available on both.

If a producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess message is received on the
"control" inbox, then a producerFinished message is sent out of the "signal"
outbox and the component terminates.

The comparison is done by the combine() method. This method returns the result
of a simple equality test of the two arguments.

You could always subclass this component and reimplement the combine() method to
perform different functions (for example, an 'adder').
