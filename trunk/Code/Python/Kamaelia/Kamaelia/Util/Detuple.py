class SimpleDetupler(Axon.Component.component):
    """
This class expects to recieve tuples (or more accurately
indexable objects) on its inboxes. It extracts the item
tuple[index] from the tuple (or indexable object) and
passes this out its outbox.

This component does not terminate.

This component was originally created for use with the
multicast component. (It could however be used for
extracting a single field from a dictionary like object).

Example usage::

    Pipeline(
        Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 1600, "224.168.2.9", 0),
        detuple(1), # Extract data, through away sender
        SRM_Receiver(),
        detuple(1),
        VorbisDecode(),
        AOAudioPlaybackAdaptor(),
    ).run()
