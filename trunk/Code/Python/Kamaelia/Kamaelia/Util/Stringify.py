=======================
Convert Data to Strings
=======================

A simple component that takes data items and converts them to strings.



Example Usage
-------------

A simple pipeline::

    Pipeline( sourceOfNonStrings(),
              Stringify(),
              consumerThatWantsStrings(),
            ).activate()
            


How does it work?
-----------------

Send data items to this component's "inbox" inbox. They are converted to
strings using the str(...) function, and sent on out of the "outbox" outbox.

Anything sent to this component's "control" inbox is ignored.

This component does not terminate.
