Kamaelia Cat logo renderer
==========================

Renderer for the topology viewer framework that renders a Kamaelia cat logo
to the top left corner on rendering pass 10.



Example Usage
-------------
Create a topology viewer component that also renders 'ExtraWindowFurniture' to the
display surface::

   TopologyViewer( extraDrawing = ExtraWindowFurniture(),
                   ...
                 ).activate()

                          
How does it work?
-----------------
Instances of this class provide a render() generator that renders a Kamaelia cat
logo at coordinates (8,8) to the specified pygame surface. The cat logo is scaled
so its longest dimension (width or height) is 64 pixels.

Rendering is performed by the generator, returned when the render() method is
called. Its behaviour is that needed for the framework for multi-pass rendering
that is used by TopologyViewer.

The generator yields the number of the rendering pass it wishes to be next on
next. Each time it is subsequently called, it performs the rendering required
for that pass. It then yields the number of the next required pass or completes
if there is no more rendering required.

An setOffset() method is also implemented to allow the particles coordinates
to be offset. This therefore makes it possible to scroll the particles around
the display surface.

See TopologyViewer for more details.
