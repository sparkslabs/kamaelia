==================
Text line splitter
==================

This component takes chunks of text and splits them at line breaks into
individual lines.



Example usage
-------------
A system that connects to a server and receives fragmented text data, but then
displays it a whole line at a time::

    Pipeline( TCPClient(host=..., port=...),
      chunks_to_lines(),
      ConsoleEcho()
    ).run()
            

            
How does it work?
-----------------

chunks_to_lines buffers all text it receives on its "inbox" inbox. If there is a
line break ("\\n") in the text it has buffered, then it extracts that line of
text, including the line break character and sends it on out of its "outbox"
outbox.

It also removes any "\\r" characters in the text.

If a producerFinished() or shutdownMicroprocess() message is received on this
component's "control" inbox, then it will send it on out of its "signal" outbox
and immediately terminate. It will not flush any whole lines of text that may
still be buffered.
