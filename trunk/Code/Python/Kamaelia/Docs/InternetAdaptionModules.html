<p>These modules provide the basic primitives relating to network handling. Essentially the</p>
<p>purpose of each file defines a basic primitive in a normal network system. </p>
<p>As with the base Kamaelia package, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is empty and simply exists to allow package import as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">import Kamaelia.Internet</span></div></ul>
<p>Clearly <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">socketConstants.py</span> contains a bunch of common constants - these aren't provided by the socket module and largely cover error conditions, and are defined to increase code readability.</p>
<p>The internet abstraction primitives can divided thus:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Connection Factories</li>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPServer.py</span> acts as a factory spawning new connections which are handled by their own components and will often have a protocol handler associated with this.</li>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPClient.py</span> also acts as a factory, but only spawns one connected socket. It acts as a data passthrough proxy for the subcomponent.</li></ul>
<div></div>
<div>Neither connection factory <span style="font-style:italic">directly </span>handles any data to/from a connected socket.</div>
<div></div>
<li>Specific Socket Handling:</li>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter.py</span> manages any connected socket.</li>
<ul type="circle"><li>Any data recieved on its <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">DataSend</span> inbox is sent to the socket in a non-blocking fashion, and any data recieved from the socket in a non-blocking fashion, is sent to the component outbox <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">outbox</span>. </li>
<li>It only attempts to get data from the socket when it recieves an appropriate message on its <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">dataReady</span> inbox.</li>
<li>When it recieves a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">producerFinished</span> message on its control port after having sent all outstanding <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">dataSend</span> messages, it goes into a shutdown mode. This results in shutdown messages being sent to the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FactoryFeedback</span> and <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">signal</span> outboxes. This is due to the <span style="font-style:italic">ownership </span>of the connected sockets being elsewhere.</li></ul>
<div>This simplicity allows the to be used <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter</span> by both the connection factories.</div></ul>
<li>Multiple socket handling.</li>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Selector.py</span> is designed for dealing with checking to see if any network connections are active, and which <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter</span>s need to be told they can/should attempt to recieve data. When it detects a server socket has a connection ready to be accepted it simply sends a message to a dynamically allocated outbox to send the appropriate <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPServer</span> factory a message to tell it to accept the connection. </li>
<div>In practice server sockets and data sockets are treated pretty much the same way - the difference of interpretation is handled by the socket adaptor or the factory. Whilst it hasn't been written this allows the &quot;select&quot; based implementation of <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Selector</span> to be replaced by a polling approach without many code changes. (Indeed this could easily be done on the fly)</div></ul>
<li>Other code:</li>
<ul type="disc"><li> <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">InternetConnection.py</span> is legacy code and due to be ditched</li>
<li> <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">InternetHandlingTests.py</span> is the current test code being used to drive integration between client/server/selector service. This is a relatively complex example:</li>
<ul type="disc"><li>It creates a SimpleServer running and EchoProtocol, and a client running an EchoCheckerProtocolComponent, and a TCPClient. The EchoCheckerProtocolComponent is wired in to handle the application communications. The client connects to the server making a complete loop.</li></ul></ul></ul>
