<p>Components only have input &amp; output boxes. For data to get from a producer (eg a file reader) to a consumer (eg an encryption component) then the output of one component, the source component, must be linked to the input of another component, the sink component.</p>
<p>These need to be registered with a postman (see below) who takes messages from the outputs and delivers them to the appropriate destination. This is NOT the usual technique for software messaging. Normally you create messages, addressed to something specific, and then the message handler delivers them.</p>
<p>However the method of communication used here is the norm for _hardware_ systems, and generally results in very pluggable components - the aim of this system, hence this design approach rather than the normal. This method of communication is also the norm for one form of software system - unix shell scripting - something that has shown itself time and again to be used in ways the inventors of programs/components never envisioned.</p>

<p>class linkage(Axon.Axon.AxonObject)</p>
<p>Linkage - Since components can only talk to local interfaces, this defines the linkages between inputs and outputs of a component. At present no argument is really optional.</p>
<p>Methods defined here:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">__init__(self, source, sink, sourcebox='outbox', sinkbox='inbox', postoffice=None, passthrough=0, pipewidth=0, synchronous=None)</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>This needs to tag the source/sink boxes as synchronous, to get component to go &quot;BANG&quot; if writing to a blocked</li></ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">__str__(self)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">dataToMove(self)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">moveData(self, force=False)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">moveDataWithCheck(self)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">setShowTransit(self, showtransit)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">setSynchronous(self, pipewidth=None)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:600">__init__</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Called with no arguments fails - raises TypeError - must supply source &amp; sink components...</li>
<li>Called with source &amp; sink components forms a non-synchronous, non-passthrough linkage between the source component's outbox to the sink component's inbox not registered with any postman...</li>
<li>Providing a pipewidth and synchronous flag set to false is an error. Raises an exception.</li>
<li>Providing a pipewidth automatically changes the source/sink boxes to being synchronised - with a maximum number of items in transit. (Clearly just stored by the object during initialisation). ttbw</li>
<li>The synchronous flag is stored to note whether the linkage limits deliveries based on whether the recipient (sink) box has space to recieve data. Source &amp; Sink boxes are changed to be synchronous if they were not originally defined to be so. ttbw</li>
<li>When created with a defined postoffice/postman, the linkage registers itself with that postman.</li>
<li>called with both source/sink in/outboxes in addition to min-args forms a linkage between the specified source/sink boxes.</li>
<li>called with passthrough set to 0 results in a standard non-passthrough outbox to inbox linkage.</li>
<li>called with passthrough set to 1 means the source and sink boxes are both inboxes. This means the linkage is passthrough-inbound (normally from the inbox of a wrapper component to the inbox of a worker/sub-component). </li>
<li>called with passthrough set to 2 means the source and sink boxes are both outboxes. This means the linkage is passthrough-outbound (normally from the outbox of a worker/sub-component to the outbox of a wrapper component ). ttbw</li></ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">__str__</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Returns a string that indicates the link source and sink components and boxes.  Precise formatting is checked.</li></ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:600">dataToMove</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Checks whether the source has any data available on it that needs moving to the sink.</li>
<li>Checks whether the source has any data available on it that needs moving to the sink.  Passthrough inbox-&gt;inbox test.</li>
<li>Checks whether the source outbox has any data available on it.  This works on normal linkages.</li></ul>

<ul type="disc"><li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>Moves data from source to sink.  Forces despite full pipe.</li>
<li>Moves data from source to sink.  Forces move despite pipewidth.</li>
<li>Moves data from source to sink.  One item is moved if there is room in the sink box.  IndexError is thrown if source box is empty so check with dataToMove before calling unless you know there is an item available.</li>
<li>Moves data from source to sink.  One item is moved if there is room in the sink box.  IndexError is thrown if source box is empty so check with dataToMove before calling unless you know there is an item available.</li>
<li>Moves data from source to sink.  One item is moved if there is room in the sink box.  noSpaceInBox is thrown if _deliver is called and source box is full.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight:600">setSynchronous</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Makes a linkage synchronous with its current pipewidth, will default to 1. Calls _synchronised Box on each component so that the boxes are setup correctly.</li>
<li>Makes a linkage synchronous with its the argument as the pipewidth.</li></ul>
