This is a simple demonstration program that shows that it is possible to
build simple clients for manually connecting to SSL based sources - such
as HTTPS sources.

This program connects the the subversion server for Kamaelia on port
443 on sourceforge - ie on kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net. When you are
connected you are connected through an encrypted connection, which means
you could type the following and get code back from the server:

GET /svnroot/kamaelia/trunk/Code/Python/Kamaelia/Examples/SimpleGraphicalApps/Ticker/Ulysses HTTP/1.0
Host: kamaelia.svn.sourceforge.net

That's pretty much the purpose of this example program.
