This directory contains the multicast transceiver version of the TCP based
simple streaming server in examples 2 & 3. If you are running this on a
single system, then you will want to run the "System" version. If you are
running this on 2 or more machines, you will want to run the server on one
of them, and clients on the rest. If you wish the server to also be a
client, simply run the "System" version, on that and clients on the rest.

However!

START THE CLIENTS FIRST - this is partly due to a limitation in ogg vorbis.

(Codebooks are stored just once in the stream, so clients joining a stream
halfway through have to deal with this problem by getting the codebook
packets from elsewhere, amongst other problems.)

Furthermore, expect the stream to be *very* choppy.
