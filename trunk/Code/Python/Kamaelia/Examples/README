Examples
--------

This directory contains a number of subdirectories, each with a specific
example.
   * Example 1 : Contains a simple "FortuneCookie" protocol system. Includes
     a server and client as part of a single system.

   * Example 2 : This has much the same structure, but rather than serve
     and display fortune cookies, serves (ogg vorbis) audio over a TCP
     connection to a client which decodes and plays back the audio.

   * Example 3 : Splits the structure in example 2 into a specific server
     application and a client application. This puts the two halves at odds,
     *competing* with each other for CPU time. Thus if both are run on the
     same (single CPU) system you will hear audio breakage. If run on
     separate machines (as client and server(!)) you won't hear this. In
     practice, part of the issue is that there is no buffering in the
     receiver.

   * Example 4 : 
     (Will be a similar simple streaming system using multicast instead of
     unicast)
