The reason for this is twofold:

   * The user has chosen to link the graphlines control passed through to a
     child
   * That child does not tell the other components to shutdown, so they
     don't. 
   * No one passes on the shutdown as a result to the outside world, meaning
     the Whinger() keeps on whinging.
