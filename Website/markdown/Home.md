Kamaelia - Concurrency made useful, fun
=======================================

In Kamaelia you build systems from **simple components that talk to each
other**. This speeds development, massively aids maintenance and also
means you **build naturally concurrent software**. It\'s intended to be
accessible by **any** developer, including novices. It also makes it fun
:)

What sort of systems? Network servers, clients, desktop applications,
pygame based games, transcode systems and pipelines, digital TV systems,
[spam eradicators](/KamaeliaGrey.html), [teaching
tools](/SpeakAndWrite.html), and a fair amount more :)

Current Release: [1.14.34 (2024/3/24)](https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/releases/tag/v1.14.34)

### Kamaelia based systems

There\'s quite a few Kamaelia systems as example applications in [the
repository on
github](https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/tree/master/Code/Python/Apps).
Some sample apps:

### [Kamaelia Grey](/KamaeliaGrey.html)

Spam reduction through greylisting. Kamaelia Grey is a SMTP proxy for
your inbound email, rejecting email likely to be spam. Mail likely to
not be spam is forwarded to your normal mail server.

### [Batch Transcoder](/ActiveFileProcessor.html)

This watches directories for new images and videos to transcode to
formats suitable for the web. You can think of it as the backend needed
for a youtube/flickr type site. PDF support is likely to be added soon.

### [Whiteboard](/Developers/Projects/Whiteboard.html)

A collaborative whiteboard. 2 or more machines share a display you can
write on - either can be a server. Whiteboards are paginated, and
therefore can also be used for remote presentations. Really cool with a
tablet.

### [Macro](/KamaeliaMacro.html)

Records and transcodes digital TV for later viewing (ie timeshifting).
It can do this for as many channels at once as you have CPU power and
tuners available for it.

Kamaelia Documentation
----------------------

### Build & improve Kamaelia based systems

### Documentation

Documentation is a core asset in Kamaelia. As of March 2024, this is now
being significantly updated.

While this is done you are invited to look at the [Component
Reference](/Components.html) for an indication of the scope of
components, and the [Cookbook](/Cookbook.html) for small examples.

### Books

Two major pieces of Kamaelia documentation are booksized PDFs:

-   [The Kamaelia Europython
    tutorial](/downloads/20090619.KamaeliaPragmaticConcurrencyEuropython09.Final.pdf).
    This is an 84 page book teaching you the ideas behind Kamaelia,
    building your own core, building components and systems.
-   [A newer \>400 page API reference
    book](/downloads/AxonKamaelia_docs.pdf), which documentation
    autogenerated & extracted from the codebase - covering both Axon and
    Kamaelia. (This is new as of Jan 2024 and a bit rough around the
    edges!)

### [Cookbook](/Cookbook.html)

This section contains a number of recipes showing how to build a variety
of different types of Kamaelia systems. Sections include:

-   Linking components together
-   Building Network systems, clients, servers, IM, etc
-   Building Digital TV systems
-   Building Multimedia systems
-   Using Kamaelia components & subsystems in non-kamaelia systems.

**More recipes always welcome.**

### [Component Reference](/Components.html)

Full component reference.

### [Axon Reference](/Docs/Axon/Axon.html)

Full reference for Axon - the core of Kamaelia.

### [Tutorials](/Tutorials.html)

-   Dive into [Kamaelia tutorials from a variety of perspectives](/Tutorials.html)
-   See the [presentations given publicly](/Presentations.html)

### Kamaelia is open source, help us improve it!

### [Source](/Repository.html) 

Kamaelia\'s source is hosted on
[Github](https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/). 

### [Release](/Releases.html)

The first release of the Kamaelia \"refresh\" project has been made:

* Github: [1.14.32 (2024/3/24)](https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/releases/tag/v1.14.32)
* PyPI - 2 packages [kamaelia-axon](https://pypi.org/project/kamaelia-axon/) and [kamaelia](https://pypi.org/project/kamaelia/)

These assume Python 3 only. This should be considered an alpha release.
The older python2.7 releases are no longer supported with immediate effect.

### [Get Help (Contact)](/Contact.html)

For now, please contact us by [opening a github
issue](https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/issues) on the project
repo.

### [Summer of Code](/SummerOfCode.html)

We\'ve were involved with GSOC some time ago.  We did this for 3 years
running in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It generated a wealth of components,
documentation and ideas that may still be of interest and are linked
to here. More than anything it proved that Kamaelia was accessible to
novice developers. This content is likely to move and be updated to
reflect the modern ecosystem, but is likely interesting in the meantime.

### [Community Console](/Developers/)

<i>(Please note - this section is somewhat out of date as of 2024, and 
will be updated. However, it does accurately reflect how Kamaelia's
primary development phase was managed)</i>

Interested in helping out? You\'re more than welcome! In this area
you\'ll find some pages which cover some areas of interest for ongoing
dev, our general development process, project management process,
guidelines on contributing (eg smart questions, through to code, and
contributor agreements)

<!--
The latest release is
somewhat out of data at this point and is to be used (with caution) with
Python 2.7. That release is the [1.0.12.0
release](/release/MonthlyReleases/Kamaelia-1.0.12.0.tar.gz). (Y.Y.M.r).
Some [apps](/release/) are also available in the release directory.

**Note:** That release is being retired as part of the 2024 update, and
will be replaced with a python 3 compatible version instead. (Much of
Kamaelia has worked with python 3 for a number of years now)

### Downloads

Please note that these are somewhat out of date, and to be used with
caution with Python 2.7. As of Jan 2024, this site and the codebase are
being updated, and this process is being tracked in Kamaelia\'s issues.
In the mean time:

[Current Release 1.0.12.0 (December 30th 2010)](/release/MonthlyReleases/Kamaelia-1.0.12.0.tar.gz)

A quick overview
================

::: {.boxright}
There is a [BBC R&D Whitepaper on Kamaelia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper113).

The project grew significantly after this whitepaper was written, but it\'s
useful to give the original context:

**[WHP 113: Kamaelia: highly concurrent and network systems tamed (2005)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper113)**

*Kamaelia is a project aimed at building large scale online media delivery
systems for the long term.  \[\.\.\.\] A key aim of Kamaelia is to enable even
novice programmers to create scalable and safe concurrent systems, quickly
and easily.*

:::
[Kamaelia](/Home.html) is a Python library by [BBC Research](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd)
for concurrent programming using a simple pattern of components that send
and receive data from each other.
The following is an example of a system made by piping the output of one
component into another:

<blockquote>
```{.python}
from Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline import Pipeline
from Kamaelia.Util.Console import ConsoleReader, ConsoleEchoer

Pipeline(
    ConsoleReader(),
    ConsoleEchoer(),
).run()
```
</blockquote>

Or maybe you want to build a presentation tool? (imports & setup
excluded here - [full example](/Examples/SimplestPresentationTool.html))

<blockquote>
```{.python}
Graphline(
     CHOOSER = Chooser(items = files),
     IMAGE = Image(size=(800,600), position=(8,48)),
     NEXT = Button(caption="Next", msg="NEXT", position=(72,8)),
     PREVIOUS = Button(caption="Previous", msg="PREV",position=(8,8)),
     FIRST = Button(caption="First", msg="FIRST",position=(256,8)),
     LAST = Button(caption="Last", msg="LAST",position=(320,8)),
     linkages = {
        ("NEXT","outbox") : ("CHOOSER","inbox"),
        ("PREVIOUS","outbox") : ("CHOOSER","inbox"),
        ("FIRST","outbox") : ("CHOOSER","inbox"),
        ("LAST","outbox") : ("CHOOSER","inbox"),
        ("CHOOSER","outbox") : ("IMAGE","inbox"),
     }
).run()
```
</blockquote>

That\'s all well and good, but how is a component written? What\'s
inside it?\

<blockquote>
```{.python}
from Axon.Component import component
from Axon.Ipc import shutdownMicroprocess, producerFinished

class MyComponent(component):
    Inboxes = {"inbox"        : "some data in",
               "control"      : "stops the component"}
    Outboxes = {"outbox"      : "some data out",
                "signal"      : "Shutdown signal"}

    def __init__(self, **argd):
        super(MyComponent, self).__init__(**argd)

    def main(self):
        while not self.doShutdown():
            if self.dataReady("inbox"):
                data = self.recv("inbox")
                # let's echo what we received...
                self.send(data, "outbox")

            if not self.anyReady():
                self.pause()

            yield 1

    def doShutdown(self):
       if self.dataReady("control"):
            mes = self.recv("control")
            if isinstance(mes, shutdownMicroprocess) or isinstance(mes, producerFinished):
                self.send(producerFinished(), "signal")
                return True
        return False
```
</blockquote>

This is the simplest form a component can take. A component:

-   is a class that inherits from `Axon.Component.component`
-   has inboxes and outboxes

By inheriting from `Axon.Component.component` you make your class usable
by the [Axon](/MiniAxon.html) library which is at the core of the
Kamaelia library. It allows for your class to be used with other
components.

Inboxes and outboxes allow your component to be linked to and from by
other components.

Then your class defines a main method that simple loop until a specific
kind of message is put into the \"control\" inbox of the component.
During the looping it checks for any inboxes and process data read from
them. Eventually it yields to the Axon scheduler that goes to the next
available component. By using a generator we allow the scheduler to come
back to the component\'s loop eventually.

Note that inboxes and outboxes are pure Python dictionary hence they
allow for any Python objects and are not limited to strings. The
component described above is simple, complex components have many
inboxes and outboxes to link to and from.

Kamaelia
--------

Kamaelia is a library of components for [all kind of tasks and
topics](/Components.html):

For example taking the previous example we could write:

<blockquote>
```{.python}
from Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline import Pipeline
from Kamaelia.Util.Consoleimport ConsoleReader, ConsoleEchoer

Pipeline(
         ConsoleReader(),
         MyComponent(),
         ConsoleEchoer(),
).run()
```
</blockquote>

[Pipeline](/Components/pydoc/Kamaelia.Experimental.Chassis.Pipeline.html)
is component that automatically links outboxes to inboxes of each
provided component. The console components allow for reading and writing
data from and to the command line. Because `Pipeline` is also a
component itself it could in turns be used in another component.

Note that calling the `run()` method on a component blocks the process
until it is killed. You can also simply activate a component which will
then be in an active state but will run only when eventually `run` is
called on another component.

Now that you have the basics of Kamaelia you should dive into the
[documentation](/Cookbook.html) and have fun with this library.
