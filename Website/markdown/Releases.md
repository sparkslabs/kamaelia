## Downloads:

The first release of the Kamaelia \"refresh\" project has been made:

* Github: [1.14.32 (2024/3/24)](https://github.com/sparkslabs/kamaelia/releases/tag/v1.14.32)
* PyPI - 2 packages [kamaelia-axon](https://pypi.org/project/kamaelia-axon/) and [kamaelia](https://pypi.org/project/kamaelia/)
* Debian packages can be built from the repo

These assume Python 3 only. This should be considered an alpha release.
The older python 2.7 releases are no longer supported with immediate effect.

## Historical Note

Over time, Kamaelia and Axon have had numerous releases. As of Feb 2024, the
project is adopting semantic versioning inline with other projects the core
maintainer maintains. Previously the project used a numbering system akin to
Ubuntu (based on dates) and before that a more adhoc approach. This is
changing with immediate effect.

## Semver rationale:

Specifically this means for STABLE releases:

* MAJOR >= 1 - increases when the "project API" change in a non-backwards compatible manner
* MINOR - increases with new features in a backwards compatible manner
* PATCH - increases when functionality is fixed/minor improvements in a backwards compatible manner.

For DEVELOPMENT releases:

* MAJOR == 0 - Never increases.
* MINOR - increases with new features (Whether backwards compatible of not)
* PATCH - increases when functionality is fixed/minor improvements in a backwards compatible manner.

This aspect for Development/experimental releases is not something which
Semantic versioning tends to deal with by default.

## Version Mapping

**Prior to the refresh, the last releases were**:

* Kamaelia's : 1.0.12.0
* Axon's : 1.7.1

To simplify things, for both Axon & Kamaelia:

* Major version for both will become *1* - no breaking changes
* Minor verson for both will become *13* - this is a new feature
* Patch version will be a count of the number of releases that are listed
  below. That count is 30 (19 + 11)

The base version for the new versioning following semantic versioning
was rationalised as follows: The new BASE release version numbers for BOTH
Kamaelia and Axon going forward was chosen to be 1.13.31 . The reason for 31
not 30, is because this is will be the 31st release.

Since then we've had a public release, which is 1.14.32. Later iterations
will increase as per "Semver rationale" above.
